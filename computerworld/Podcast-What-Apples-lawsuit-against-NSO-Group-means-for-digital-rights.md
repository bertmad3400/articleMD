# Podcast: What Apple's lawsuit against NSO Group means for digital rights
### Last week, Apple filed a lawsuit against NSO Group, the technology firm behind the Pegasus spyware. In its lawsuit, Apple seeks to hold NSO Group accountable for alleged surveillance of select iPhone users, as well as ban the firm from using any Apple products. While digital rights activists commend Apple for standing up for privacy rights, they say they want to ensure that the precedent set by the case applies only to bad actors and not organizations in support of user privacy. Computerworld executive editor Ken Mingis and senior reporter Lucas Mearian join Juliet to discuss what the lawsuit means for Apple, those affected by the spyware and digital rights overall.
