# A New Security Paradigm: External Attack Surface Management
### Advanced EASM solutions are crucial to automating the discovery of the downstream third-party (or fourth-party, or fifth-party, etc.) IT infrastructures that your organization is exposed to, and may be vulnerable to attack, posing a critical risk for your organization.

In the past, a web application or online service could be taken at face value by your customers and employees. It was created, developed, and secured by your organization, and every element of the IT infrastructure that supported that service was under your control.


Today, all that has changed. Internet-facing services are built on an ecosystem of third-party services and infrastructures, which in turn are built on even more third-party infrastructures. For example, a single page in a web application can rely on content and code from hundreds of different third-party sources such as user trackers, ads, fonts, and many others.


While some of these sources and services may be under your direct control, most are not. The majority of these third-party assets and sources are ***indirectly*** tied to your organization’s websites, applications, and core IT network – yet you are responsible for the security of this entire ecosystem. A breach anywhere along these chains could lead to a compromise of your services and ultimately your users, customers, and business.


[Gartner](https://www.cyberpion.com/resources/critical-insights-for-external-attack-surface-management/) calls this highly-exposed ecosystem your “external attack surface,” and has recently recommended adopting an External Attack Surface Management (EASM) approach. In this article, we’ll drill into the capacities of EASM solutions, and how companies can use them.


**External Attack Surface Management Explained**
------------------------------------------------


Gartner defines EASM as “the processes, technology and professional services deployed to discover external-facing enterprise assets and systems that may present vulnerabilities.”


Advanced EASM solutions are crucial to automating the discovery of the downstream third-party (or fourth-party, or fifth-party, etc.) services that your organization is exposed to, and may be vulnerable to attack, posing a critical risk for your organization.


EASM platforms provide the capabilities necessary for security organizations to protect their organization from vulnerabilities:


**Applying EASM**
-----------------


Organizations also use EASM solutions to achieve a number of secondary, yet equally important, security goals including:


**The Bottom Line: EASM is Part of Today’s Security Picture**
-------------------------------------------------------------


Hackers are increasingly targeting the IT infrastructures of your third-party vendors – rather than attacking your security perimeter head-on. EASM solutions enable your security team to take a proactive approach to resolve the vulnerabilities within their entire IT ecosystem.


EASM needs to be closely integrated and overlaid with additional enterprise vulnerability and threat management platforms. Adopting the right EASM solution gives your organization a broader view and coordinated approach towards enterprise security that is a more effective way to mitigate risk. As we read news reports of the growing number of breaches that occur due to a breach at a third-party vendor, enterprises need to adopt these kinds of solutions yesterday, to meet the very real security challenges of today.
