In a startling discovery, a [recent report](https://ermetic.com/whats-new/news/ermetic-reports-nearly-100-of-companies-experienced-a-cloud-data-breach-in-past-18-months/) found that 98 percent of companies have experienced at least one cloud data breach in the past 18 months, compared to 79 percent last year. The same report disclosed that nearly 60 percent of the 200 CISOs and security decision-makers surveyed considered lack of visibility, and inadequate identity and access management, a major threat to their cloud infrastructure.


From ransomware threats to malware attacks, businesses across the globe are experiencing an overwhelming increase in cybersecurity breaches that are both devastating and well-coordinated. Whether designed for individuals to click on compromising web pages or open infected email attachments, most cyberattacks today target human error. In addition to the technology available to keep us safe, your organization also depends heavily on its people to make the right security decisions.

So now more than ever, organizations must build up their defenses against persistent attackers who have for instance skillfully mastered the art of abusing weak credentials (one of the many risks, arising from people choosing convenient, easy-to-remember passwords or reusing them across accounts).


**Incident Response Plan Checklist**
------------------------------------


To avoid having to go into emergency-recovery mode during an attack, corporations should methodically plan and prepare for cyber-incidents using the following incident-response checklist, for minimized damage and a swift recovery.


A strong incident-response plan can help a company recover quickly and reduce incident costs. It’s also critical to not only have an incident-response plan, but also to be “incident-response ready,” which means that the plan is periodically tested, similar to a fire drill.


*Throughout this step, organizations need to anticipate potential legal outcomes and any impacts on regulations. Businesses need to ask whether their company’s services should continue during the incident or if law enforcement needs to become involved, depending on the severity and sensitivity of the incident.*


Creating an incident plan is a time-consuming and daunting task, especially when it feels as if your company is invincible against attacks. But the fact is, with the ever-increasing size of the cyber-threat landscape, and the potential for human error, it is becoming more likely that your organization will become a victim of cybercrime.


How prepared you are will determine the overall impact on your business? It is wise to have a clear and solidified incident-response plan to help your organizations do everything possible to reduce the potential impact and risks of a cyberattack. Be incident-response ready, and have a solid incident-response plan to help your organizations recover quickly.
