# Attackers Will Flock to Crypto Wallets, Linux in 2022:  Podcast
### That’s just the start of what cyberattackers will zero in on as they pick up APT techniques to hurl more destructive ransomware & supply-chain attacks, says Fortinet’s Derek Manky.

Ransomware is on the rise, and attackers are massing in never-before-seen numbers, lining up to find victims.


Could the new year possibly get any worse? According to [FortiGuard Labs](https://www.fortinet.com/fortiguard/labs?utm_source=blog&utm_campaign=fortiguardlabs), the answer is yes. According to its [2022 predictions](https://www.fortinet.com/blog/threat-research/security-predictions-for-2022-tomorrows-threats-will-target-the-expanding-attack-surface), upcoming threats will target an expanding attack surface, meaning that 2022 is “shaping up to be a banner year for cybercriminals. … Attacks will continue to span the entire attack surface, leaving IT teams scrambling to cover every possible avenue of attack.”


[![Infosec Insiders Newsletter](https://media.threatpost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/103/2021/07/10165815/infosec_insiders_in_article_promo.png)](https://threatpost.com/infosec-insider-subscription-page/?utm_source=ART&utm_medium=ART&utm_campaign=InfosecInsiders_Newsletter_Promo/)  

“Cybercriminals are evolving and becoming more like traditional APT groups; zero-day equipped, destructive, and able to expand their techniques as needed to achieve their goals,” [according to Fortinet](https://www.fortinet.com/corporate/about-us/newsroom/press-releases/2021/fortiguard-labs-predicts-cyberattacks-aimed-everything-crypto-wallets-satellite-internet). “We will see attacks spanning further outside of the extended network, even into space, as attackers take advantage of a fragmented perimeter, siloed teams and tools as well as a greatly expanded attack surface. These threats will leave overwhelmed IT teams scrambling to cover every possible avenue of attack.”


The author of that report is Derek Manky: chief, security insights & global threat alliances, for FortiGuard Labs. He recently visited the Threatpost podcast to discuss what FortiGuard Labs is seeing, be it more [Mirai](https://threatpost.com/mirai-variant-sonicwall-d-link-iot/164811/) – the No. 1 botnet listed in the company’s threat landscape report ([PDF](https://www.fortinet.com/content/dam/fortinet/assets/threat-reports/report-threat-landscape-2021.pdf)) for the first half of 2021 – to more [Linux-based botnets](https://threatpost.com/linux-attack-freakout-malware/163137/) and more.


“We’re going to fully expect to see more of [Mirai],” Manky predicted. “More Linux-based botnets. A lot of these targets, we’re not talking about Windows, but MacOS, we’ve already seen more and more … code written for Linux itself, and that is a majority of the [internet of things, or IoT] space.”


Fortinet is also predicting that attacks will continue to span the network, including an increase in attacks targeting [Operational Technology](https://www.fortinet.com/solutions/industries/scada-industrial-control-systems/what-is-ot-security.html?utm_source=blog&utm_campaign=what-is-ot) (OT) systems, Manky said. It makes sense, he said, given that  “That’s where the bigger dollars are.”
