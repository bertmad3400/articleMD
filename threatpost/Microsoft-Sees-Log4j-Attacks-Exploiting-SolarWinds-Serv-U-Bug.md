Threat actors have weaponized a newly discovered bug in [SolarWinds Serv-U](https://www.solarwinds.com/resources/video/serv-u-ftp-and-serv-u-mft-affordable-file-sharing-software#:~:text=SolarWinds%C2%AE%20Serv%2DU%C2%AE,MFT%20sharing%20and%20file%20transfer.&text=Serv%2DU%20FTP%20is%20designed,protect%20your%20data%20in%20transit.) file-sharing software to launch Log4j attacks against networks’ internal devices, Microsoft warned on Wednesday.


SolarWinds issued a fix the day before, on Tuesday.


The vulnerability, tracked as [CVE-2021-35247](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-35247), is an input validation flaw that could allow attackers to build a query, given some input, and to send that query over the network without sanitation, Microsoft’s Threat Intelligence Center (MSTIC) [said](https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/2021/12/11/guidance-for-preventing-detecting-and-hunting-for-cve-2021-44228-log4j-2-exploitation/#CVE-2021-35247).

The bug, discovered by Microsoft’s Jonathan Bar Or, affects Serv-U versions 15.2.5 and prior. SolarWinds fixed the vulnerability in Serv-U version 15.3, [released](https://www.solarwinds.com/trust-center/security-advisories/cve-2021-35247) on Tuesday.


“The Serv-U web login screen to LDAP authentication was allowing characters that were not sufficiently sanitized,” SolarWinds [said](https://www.solarwinds.com/trust-center/security-advisories/cve-2021-35247) in its advisory, adding that it had updated the input mechanism “to perform additional validation and sanitization.”


SolarWinds said that it hasn’t seen any “downstream [effect],” given that “the LDAP servers ignored improper characters.”


For its part, MSTIC didn’t give details about the attacks it’s tracked that have been propagated via the Serv-U bug.


Just the Latest in Ongoing Log4j Barrage
----------------------------------------


The Serv-U attacks are just the latest in the rampant Log4j exploit attempts and testing that have been [thrown at](https://threatpost.com/microsoft-rampant-log4j-exploits-testing/177358/) the multiple flaws in Apache’s [Log4j logging library](https://threatpost.com/log4j-vulnerability-pressures-security-world/177721/) since those flaws were [disclosed](https://threatpost.com/zero-day-in-ubiquitous-apache-log4j-tool-under-active-attack/176937/) – and came under near-immediate attack – last month.


On Tuesday, Akamai researchers also [reported](https://www.akamai.com/blog/security/mirai-botnet-abusing-log4j-vulnerability) that they’ve detected evidence of the unauthenticated remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability in Log4j – tracked as CVE-2021-44228 – being adapted to infect and assist in the proliferation of malware used by the [Mirai](https://threatpost.com/gafgyt-botnet-ddos-mirai/165424/) botnet by targeting [Zyxel networking devices](https://www.zyxel.com/us/en/support/Zyxel_security_advisory_for_Apache_Log4j_RCE_vulnerability.shtml).


MSTIC strongly recommended that affected customers apply the SolarWinds security updates.
