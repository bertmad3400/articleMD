Christine Leahy, CEO of CDW, said adding Focal Point's "array of security consulting, customer workforce skills development and professional services capabilities" would help expand the company's portfolio and enhance their ability to "address risks posed by malicious cyber threats and cyber workforce shortages, while helping customers successfully navigate shifting data protection laws."
