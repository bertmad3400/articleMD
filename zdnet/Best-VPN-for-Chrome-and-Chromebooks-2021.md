You would think that the method of protecting Chrome browsing would be the same for Chrome as for Chromebooks. After all, Chromebooks are pretty much machines designed to run Chrome. But there are differences, and we'll discuss that in this article. 


Desktop Chrome on PCs and Macs is best protected by VPN applications designed for those operating systems. We've done closer look articles into both of those categories, which should help.  

**See:** 

* [**Best VPN for Macs**](https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-mac-vpn/)
* **[Best VPN for Windows PC](https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-vpn-for-windows-pc/)**
* **[How to set up and use a VPN on Windows, Mac, iOS, or Android](https://www.zdnet.com/article/how-to-install-a-vpn-on-ios-mac-windows-and-android/)** 

Essentially, you're installing a VPN application that runs in the background and protects all network traffic. Chrome extensions are available for most of the popular VPN services that allow you to turn on and off features, and provide some added WebRTC protections.  

For iOS and Android, users also will install a device-wide application. Mobile Chrome doesn't support extensions, so your device-based app is your best defense. 

If you want to protect a Chromebook, the Chrome browser extension isn't enough. The way most VPN vendors recommend you protect your Chromebook is by installing their Android app. Android apps now run on most modern Chromebooks, but older Chromebooks don't have that capability. Be sure to check each vendor's compatibility list. Once you install their Android app on the Chromebook, you're generally protected. 

Finally, for Linux devices running Chrome, some vendors offer a Linux binary, but the most common method is to install VPN software on a router, and then run all traffic through that router. That doesn't help for mobile Linux users, but it's a start. 






Let's take a look at four of our favorite VPN services and see how they do with Chrome and Chromebook.
