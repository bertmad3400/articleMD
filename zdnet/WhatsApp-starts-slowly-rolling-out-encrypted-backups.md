 WhatsApp has said it is starting to slowly roll out the [encrypted backups](https://www.zdnet.com/article/whatsapp-details-plans-to-offer-encrypted-backups/) feature it detailed in September. 

"Starting today, we are making available an extra, optional layer of security to protect backups stored on Google Drive or iCloud with end-to-end encryption," the company said in a [blog post](https://about.fb.com/news/2021/10/end-to-end-encrypted-backups-on-whatsapp/). 

"No other global messaging service at this scale provides this level of security for their users' messages, media, voice messages, video calls and chat backups." 

Users will have a choice for how the encryption key used is stored. 

The simplest is for users to keep a record of the random 64-digit key themselves, akin to how Signal handles backups, which they would need to re-enter to restore a backup. 

The alternative would be for the random key to be stored in WhatsApp's infrastructure, dubbed as a hardware security module-based Backup Key Vault that would be accessible via a user-created password.

For redundancy purposes, WhatsApp said the key would be distributed through multiple data centres that operate on a consensus model. 






WhatsApp said it would only know that a key exists in its vault, but would not know the key itself. 

The backups would store message text, as well as photos and videos received, WhatsApp said.
