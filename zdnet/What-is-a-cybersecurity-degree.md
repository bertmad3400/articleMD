Cybersecurity degree courses
----------------------------

Cybersecurity students learn fundamental principles and programming languages early in their education. As they gain more advanced skills, they study concepts like ethical hacking and vulnerability assessment. Below are a few classes commonly required in cybersecurity programs.

**Certified ethical hacking**

Ethical hackers, also known as white hat hackers, test a system's security procedures to improve them. In ethical hacking courses, learners explore penetration testing and ethical hacking techniques. They also learn how to implement security measures. The course prepares learners for the [Certified Ethical Hacker certification](https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-ethical-hacking-certification/).

**Networking concepts**

Diverse organizations rely on networks to connect their systems, interact with customers, and store and retrieve data. In networking concepts courses, learners explore common network configurations, network security, and vulnerabilities in computer networks. The course prepares learners for cybersecurity roles requiring strong networking skills.

**Principles of programming languages**

Like many other tech fields, cybersecurity jobs require programming skills. Courses in programming introduce learners to important programming languages and key concepts in computer programming. Theory-oriented courses cover topics like syntax, memory management, and control structures. 

**Python programming**

Many cybersecurity professionals use Python as their primary coding language. During an undergraduate cybersecurity program, learners build fluency in Python through project-based assignments and lessons. The course introduces students to Python tools and the language's applications in information assurance.

**Vulnerability assessment**

Cybersecurity professionals identify threats and system vulnerabilities. This course trains students to assess an organization's information security vulnerabilities. Students conduct penetration testing, evaluate infrastructure, and recommend improvements to the security system. The class prepares students for careers as cybersecurity analysts and consultants.
