How hard is it to keep your iPhone -- and the data that's on it -- safe from hackers and other bad folks out there? 

Not hard at all. 

While there's no doubt that security is a massive subject, and you could devote your life to it, it's not hard to get to a point where your iPhone is more secure than 99 percent of other iPhones out there.

Here's now.

### #1: Updates

Make sure that your iOS is up to date. This is your primary line of defense against vulnerabilities. I know, I know, there are a lot of them, but that's the world we live in these days.

It's also a good idea to keep your apps updated too, but that's secondary to keeping iOS updated. 






Personally, given the number of bugfixes in recent iOS releases, I don't wait to install them. Sure, there might be bugs like battery issues and such that creep in to iOS releases, but these are, as far as I'm concerned, less of a problem.

### #2: Strong passcode

If you're still rolling with 000000 or 123456 or something dumb like that, change it. 

Do it now.

While web-based attacks do happen, the most likely way that your data is going to leak from your iPhone is by someone picking it up and unlocking it.

### #3: Reboot weekly

Most iPhone vulnerabilities rely on jailbreaking the iPhone. 

The good news is that a jailbreak can't survive a reboot, so adding a weekly reboot to your schedule is no bad thing. 

Not only does it protect you from badness from getting onto your iPhone but it'll also speed things up a bit by clearing the RAM.
