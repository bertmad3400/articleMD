### We don't just test VPN provider performance in this in-depth analysis. We went out onto the internet and gathered performance data from all across the web to let you know which provider -- according to VPN performance tests independently conducted by 11 different publications -- has the best overall and most consistent performance.

Most people choose to use a VPN for privacy and security reasons, with the purpose of remaining safe online. Beyond preventing their data from being intercepted, they also want to obscure their location, change their apparent country of origin, and -- sometimes -- violate terms of service by watching entertainment they're not supposed to access. 

But because all that data has to go through the VPN provider's network, there's natural friction applied to data transmission rates. With a few exceptions, using a VPN slows down your network access. Most of the time, that performance hit isn't enough to reduce your quality of service, but it can have an impact on your network usage. As such, finding out which VPNs are the fastest -- in other words, what VPNs don't suck your performance away -- can be important to your online experience.

 When it comes to ping speeds, the results were also counterintuitive. All our profiled providers showed an improvement in average ping speeds compared to use without a VPN. The only reason this makes sense is if you realize that you're probably reducing server-to-server hops to an international destination when you travel through a VPN. 'Tis cool.

 Finally, we looked at time to connect. When you start up the VPN service, how long does it take to achieve communication? While you're not likely to make connections except once per session at your device, waiting as much as 16 seconds (as it was on average for [NordVPN](https://go.nordvpn.net/aff_c?offer_id=378&aff_id=307&source=zdnet)) can seem like an awfully long time compared to a little under two seconds (which we found, on average, for [Hotspot Shield](https://hotspotshield.bvrd.net/c/159047/570902/1691?subId1=zd-4c9dd4212b5b4c558f5fba8de0009dd1--&sharedId=zdnet&u=https://www.hotspotshield.com/)).

 You can see the raw performance data for each of our profiled VPNs in the following reviews:

 Chart: ZDNet/David Gewirtz
 There are two data series modeled on the chart. The vertical columns represent the average ranking for each vendor. Lower is better in this case, so a vendor with an average rank of 2.00 performs better than a vendor with an average rank of, say, 6.33.

But it's the line chart that helps put these numbers in perspective. The line chart represents the [standard deviation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_deviation) of the score data on a vendor-by-vendor basis. Standard deviation is a measure of how spread out numbers are in a series of data. 






Take, for example, a VPN vendor who ranks in the No. 1 slot on one site and the No. 10 slot on another site. It's going to be very hard to tell from those two data points just how reliable that VPN provider's performance actually is. By contrast, if you have another vendor who ranks as No. 5 from the same two sites, you can be pretty sure that vendor is in the middle of the pack -- because the rankings are consistent. 

That's what we wanted to know in our aggregated data analysis. Take, for example, [ExpressVPN](https://xvctlink.com/zdnet?offer=3monthsfree&a_fid=cnetvpn&data2=zdnet) which has an aggregate score of 2.33. [Hotspot Shield](https://hotspotshield.bvrd.net/c/159047/570902/1691?subId1=zd-4c9dd4212b5b4c558f5fba8de0009dd1--&sharedId=zdnet&u=https://www.hotspotshield.com/) has an aggregate score of 2.29. They're both very close. But when you factor in that [ExpressVPN's](https://xvctlink.com/zdnet?offer=3monthsfree&a_fid=cnetvpn&data2=zdnet) standard deviation across all eleven sites is 1.37, you can see that the data is pretty consistent. [ExpressVPN](https://xvctlink.com/zdnet?offer=3monthsfree&a_fid=cnetvpn&data2=zdnet) scored four 2's and a 1. 


By contrast, [Hotspot Shield's](https://hotspotshield.bvrd.net/c/159047/570902/1691?subId1=zd-4c9dd4212b5b4c558f5fba8de0009dd1--&sharedId=zdnet&u=https://www.hotspotshield.com/) scores have a standard deviation of 2.21. That means, compared to [ExpressVPN's](https://xvctlink.com/zdnet?offer=3monthsfree&a_fid=cnetvpn&data2=zdnet) 1.37, that [Hotspot Shield's](https://hotspotshield.bvrd.net/c/159047/570902/1691?subId1=zd-4c9dd4212b5b4c558f5fba8de0009dd1--&sharedId=zdnet&u=https://www.hotspotshield.com/) scores aren't as consistent. That's born out by [Hotspot Shield's](https://hotspotshield.bvrd.net/c/159047/570902/1691?subId1=zd-4c9dd4212b5b4c558f5fba8de0009dd1--&sharedId=zdnet&u=https://www.hotspotshield.com/) scores of five 1's, a 5, and a 6. Yes, [Hotspot Shield](https://hotspotshield.bvrd.net/c/159047/570902/1691?subId1=zd-4c9dd4212b5b4c558f5fba8de0009dd1--&sharedId=zdnet&u=https://www.hotspotshield.com/) did score more No. 1 wins, but it also scored a couple of substantially lower grades, making us question whether its performance is reliably excellent or whether some of you might see substantially worse performance than others using the same product. 

By this measure, [NordVPN](https://go.nordvpn.net/aff_c?offer_id=378&aff_id=307&source=zdnet) is the clear winner. It's got the best average aggregate score and the smallest standard deviation. That means its performance is consistent among all the testers and you can probably rely on it when making a buying decision. If you don't want [NordVPN](https://go.nordvpn.net/aff_c?offer_id=378&aff_id=307&source=zdnet), you can try out both [Hotspot Shield](https://hotspotshield.bvrd.net/c/159047/570902/1691?subId1=zd-4c9dd4212b5b4c558f5fba8de0009dd1--&sharedId=zdnet&u=https://www.hotspotshield.com/) and [ExpressVPN](https://xvctlink.com/zdnet?offer=3monthsfree&a_fid=cnetvpn&data2=zdnet), but because mileage did, in fact, vary, you'll want to try them both out and see what performs best for you. 

In addition to ZDNet, we aggregated data from VPN ratings on the following sites: PCMag, TechRadar, CNET, Tom's Guide, Comparitech, vpnMentor, ProPrivacy, Cloudwards, RestorePrivacy, and Top10VPN.
