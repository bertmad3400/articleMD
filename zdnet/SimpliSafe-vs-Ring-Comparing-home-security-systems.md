**How to compare home security companies**
------------------------------------------

### **Installation**

Most wireless home security systems are designed to be simple to install. But some homeowners may need a more elaborate system or prefer to let a professional handle the setup. When deciding on which system to buy, check and see if professional installation is available the cost, and any alternatives, such as access to phone support.

### **Compatibility**

Buying a home security system is an investment. To get the most out of one, choose a system that's compatible with a variety of companies and devices. You may only need a basic system now but may move into a new home or larger apartment in the future. It would be beneficial to expand its functionality with other accessories, such as environmental sensors, garage door openers or home automation.

### **Price**

There is more to a security system's cost than the upfront package price. Do your research, read the fine print and inquire about additional costs. Some of the most common to look for are late fees, activation charges, mandatory monthly monitoring, the professional monitoring price, and any early cancellation or moving penalties.

**The bottom line**
-------------------

If you consider Ring or Simplisafe as your home security solution, both systems are more similar than different. If you're looking for an entry-level home security solution that's no-frills and low cost but can expand in the future to include more home automation equipment, choose Ring. For a more professional equipment package that's more like what you'd expect from a security company, Simplisafe is the better choice.

  
 You can always try out Simplisafe for 60 days for free, which is double Ring's free trial length. If you'd like to outsource your home's monitoring, Ring's monthly monitoring service is less expensive at $10 instead of Simplisafe's $15 per month. You can't go wrong with either -- both provide a quality product at an affordable price.
