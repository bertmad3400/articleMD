Over the past months, we've published a lot of [useful information about VPNs](https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-vpn/). But this article is unique. In this article, we're going to do our best to help you save a few bucks. Below are the latest and greatest Black Friday and Cyber Monday VPN deals we've been able to scour from around the net, from the VPN vendors themselves, and from the secret whispers of VPN aficionados pumping as much caffeine into their veins as possible to keep up with their need for bits, all day and all night.

Keep in mind that VPN vendors are aggressive marketeers even outside of the silly season. But when the floodgates open up, they're getting even more enthusiastic. So while there are some not-bad Black Friday and Cyber Monday "deals" presented in this article, keep in mind that most VPN vendors are constitutionally incapable of resisting the urge to offer regular deal promotions, and you might just find good deals during other times during the year.

**Terms and conditions**

Be very careful about the terms of the deal. VPN vendors have decided to jump on the bandwagon of one of the most reprehensible tactics used by the web hosting business: listing price by month but charging by year, followed by massive jumps in prices when your service automatically renews.Â 

PureVPN, for example, promotes their offering as $2.04 per month, but they actually charge you for 24 months, or $49. Then, when 24 months pass by, they slam you with a $70 bill, bringing your monthly bill from two bucks to nearly six, a three-fold increase. IPVanish's monthly rate jumps from the $3.80/mo promo price to $7.50 per month -- and your card gets hit for $90 all at once.

One of the best ways to take advantage of these promo deals but not get slammed later is to make a calendar entry the month before renewal so you know to cancel the service before you get slammed. Since there's nothing to lock you into a VPN service (they all do basically the same stuff), you can jump onto the next service with a good deal when renewal time comes around.

So, I've listed these in order of cheapest per month to most expensive but beware of the surge with all those caveats.
