iOS 15 brings several new security features to the iPhone. But ultimately the security of a device is in the hands of the owner, who can choose to bolster that security, or weaken it.

Here's what you need to know to make your iPhone a harder target for hackers and thieves.

*Note that these settings also mostly apply to the iPad.*

### The basics

First off, everything starts off with the basics. These haven't changed in years.

Use a strong passcode using Custom Alphanumeric Code (if this is easily guessable, it's game over). 

* If you think someone knows your passcode, change it.  
Go to **Settings > Face ID & Passcode** (or **Touch ID & Passcode**).
* Turn on Face ID/Touch ID.
* Turn on screen Auto-Lock.  
Go to **Settings > Display & Brightness** and tap **Auto-Lock** and set to 30 seconds or 1 minute.
* Make sure iOS is up to date.  
Go to **Settings > General > Software Update** and make sure **Automatic Update** is enabled.
* Keep all your apps updated.  
Go to **Settings > App Store** and make sure **App Updates** are enabled.

### Keep an eye on apps that might be spying on you

A new feature in iOS 15 is the ability to log what apps are up to on your iPhone. The feature is called [Record App Activity](https://www.zdnet.com/article/ios-15-lets-you-spy-on-apps-that-might-be-spying-on-you/), and this allows you to get a lot of aach time an app does one of the following:

* The user's photo library
* A camera
* The microphone
* The user's contacts
* The user's media library
* Location data
* Screen sharing

To enable this feature, go to **Settings > Privacy** and then scroll down to find **Record App Activity**.

### Built-in authenticator






iOS 15 brings an end to having to fire up a third-party two-factor authenticator app.

Now Apple has built one right into iOS, and better still, it can even autofill the information for you.

Got to **Settings > Passwords** and then for each password entry you can tap on it to get access to an option called **Set Up Verification Codesâ€¦** that allows you to enter the information required either as using a setup key or QR code.

Using a two-factor authenticator is far more secure than relying on SMS messages, so you should use this feature -- either using Apple's authenticator or another app -- to get the highest security.

### Hide your IP address from trackers

Safari can now cloak your IP address from trackers on websites, making it pretty much impossible for your browsing to be logged.

Go to **Settings > Safari** and set **Hide IP Address** to **From Trackers**.

### Secure your browsing

If you have an iCloud+ subscription, Apple has just given you a great reason to use the Safari browser -- iCloud Private Relay. This is like a VPN in that it sends your web traffic through other servers to keep your location secret.

To enable iCloud Private Relay you'll need an iCloud+ subscription. Then go to **Settings** and at the top tap your name and then go to **iCloud** and enable **Private Relay**.

### Put a stop to email trackers

Protect Mail Activity is a feature built into the Mail app that prevents people from knowing if emails have been opened.

To enable this feature, go to **Settings > Mail**, tap on **Privacy Protection** and enable **Protect Mail Activity**.

If iCloud Private Relay is a good reason to switch to Safari, then this feature is a good reason to switch to Mail.
