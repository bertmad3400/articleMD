Carrying around unsecured data on flash drives is a bad idea. 

One mistake on your part -- or on the part of the weakest link in your organization -- and that data can be in the hands of anyone.

If that data is sensitive, then you're going to have some serious headaches, along with the potential for legal troubles and fines.

Far better to have that data properly secured and encrypted when it's on a physical device, and as tool that makes that as simple as possible is the Apricorn Aegis Padlock SSD.

This SSD drive is small enough to fit into the palm of your hand or slip into a pocket and comes in capacities ranging from 240GB to a whopping 4TB. Having this range of options is great because it means that you can buy the capacity you need, and no more, which saves money.
