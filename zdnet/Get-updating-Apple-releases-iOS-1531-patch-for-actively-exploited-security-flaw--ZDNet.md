If you didn't already upgrade to iOS 15.3, now might be a good time to do it because of a security flaw Apple has now patched.

Apple [released iOS 15.3 earlier this month](https://www.zdnet.com/article/ios-15-3-its-buggy-but-you-should-still-install-it/) but it didn't include one fix for a security flaw it has now addressed in iOS 15.3.1. 

Details from Apple, as usual, are scant but it gave enough to suggest it is a serious bug because it can lead to malicious code execution simply by users opening a web page in the Apple Safari browser. 

"Processing maliciously crafted web content may lead to arbitrary code execution. Apple is aware of a report that this issue may have been actively exploited," [Apple said](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT213093).   

The update is available for iPhone 6s and later, iPad Pro, iPad Air 2 and later, iPad 5th generation and later, iPad mini 4 and later, and iPod touch 7th generation.

Since the bug affects WebKit, the browser engine for Safari, it also affects macOS. Apple also [released macOS Monterey 12.2.1](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT213092) to address the issue on Macs.  

The bug, like many security flaws, was a memory flaw that code written in C++ is particularly prone to. 






[According to Microsoft and Google](https://www.zdnet.com/article/chrome-70-of-all-security-bugs-are-memory-safety-issues/), about 70% of a security issues are caused by memory safety problems and those issues are tied to flaws written in C and C++, arguably [the most important family of programming languages](https://www.zdnet.com/article/programming-languages-python-dominates-but-developers-are-adding-new-skills-to-stand-out/) that have been used for decades in multi-million line infrastructure systems like Windows, WebKit, Chrome, Android, [Firefox](https://www.zdnet.com/article/the-rust-programming-language-just-took-a-huge-step-forwards/), [the Linux kernel](https://www.zdnet.com/article/rust-takes-a-major-step-forward-as-linuxs-second-official-language/) and now embedded systems for Internet of Things devices.
