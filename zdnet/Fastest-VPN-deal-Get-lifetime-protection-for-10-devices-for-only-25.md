 Global corporations have been [ridiculously lazy](https://www.zdnet.com/article/may-ransomware-blight-all-the-cyber-stragglers-and-let-god-sort-them-out/) in implementing the most powerful cybersecurity measures available, which puts all of our personal data at risk. That's all the more reason to make sure your own personal security is as strong as possible, and a lifetime subscription to [FastestVPN](https://academy.zdnet.com/sales/fastestvpn-lifetime-subscription-10-user-access?utm_source=zdnet.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=fastestvpn-lifetime-subscription-10-user-access&utm_term=scsf-488504&utm_content=a0x1P000004f0FFQAY&scsonar=1) for up to 10 devices provides some of the most comprehensive protection on the market.


FastestVPN offers a smart, user-friendly service for all of your devices, including Android, iOS, Windows, Mac, your router, and even your Smart TV. It uses more than 200 high-speed servers around the world, all with military-grade 256-bit AES encryption. And you get unlimited switches between them, as well as unlimited bandwidth for the simultaneous use of your 10 devices.

An ad blocker is included for your convenience, and FastestVPN's strict no-logging policy ensures no one will have access to your personal data. Anti-malware software is included and an extra layer of protection is provided by a NAT firewall. There is even a kill switch to disconnect you from the internet if your VPN connection drops for any reason.

While some VPNs may slow down your internet connection, as you might expect from its name, FastestVPN provides all of this protection at blazing fast speeds. You can also access any content you like, regardless of geographic restrictions. Simply access the service's fastest server and you can download or stream even HD-quality video with absolute anonymity and zero buffering. USA Netflix support is included in your plan.

Given the depth of features, it should come as no surprise that TenBestVPNs said:

*"FastestVPN is one of the most promising VPN services in the market."*

You really don't want to pass up this opportunity to get a lifetime subscription to FastestVPN for 10 devices, because it's currently available at the heavily discounted price of [$24.99](https://academy.zdnet.com/sales/fastestvpn-lifetime-subscription-10-user-access?utm_source=zdnet.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=fastestvpn-lifetime-subscription-10-user-access&utm_term=scsf-488504&utm_content=a0x1P000004f0FFQAY&scsonar=1).
