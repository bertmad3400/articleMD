The Brazilian government has created a special commission aimed at tackling electronic fraud.


Created by the Ministry of Justice (MoJ) under the National Consumer Defense Council, the commission will include representatives of antitrust regulator Cade, as well as the National Confederation of Commerce, the consumer defense bodies from the states of São Paulo, Tocantins and Porto Alegre, the Federal Public Defender's Office, and the the Central Bank. 

This commission follows the recent creation of a working group, which is providing an assessment of the current online fraud landscape. The working group has the involvement of bodies such as the Brazilian Federation of Banks (Febraban) and the Central Bank.

According to the MoJ, the working group will publish a final report listing proposals for combatting online fraud. The group is also due to meet with the National Data Protection Authority.

In September, the MoJ started negotiations with Febraban about creating a [National Cybercrime Strategy.](https://www.zdnet.com/article/brazil-debates-creation-of-national-strategy-to-tackle-cybercrime/) According to Febraban, the discussions are informed by the National Strategy Against Corruption and Money Laundering, which is led by the Ministry of Justice and has been in place since 2003.

The idea is to "expand the identification and repression" of the actors responsible for cybercrimes, the commission said. Other goals include jointly developing platforms for sharing fraud data, training security forces in cybersecurity and digital fraud issues, and leading public awareness campaigns on cyber risks and fraud.
