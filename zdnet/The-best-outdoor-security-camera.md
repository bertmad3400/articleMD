**Outdoor security cameras: What you need to know**
---------------------------------------------------

When looking for an outdoor security camera system, check for convenient features with advanced technology before choosing the one that suits your needs best. Features such as night vision, ample field of view, motion detection and real-time notifications to your phone, high-quality image and weather-resistance are essential for this type of camera. 

### **Checklist for choosing an outdoor security camera**

Here is a list of elements that you need to cross out before buying your next outdoor security camera system:

* **Night vision:**[Night vision](https://www.reviews.com/home/security-systems/best-night-vision-cameras/) allows you to see what's happening even with low light. This technology usually works using infrared led lights, allowing cameras to capture good-quality video even at night.
* **Motion detection:**Motion detection technology finds real threats and alerts you to have a glimpse of what is happening and decide if you need to take action. The ideal features should include people and animal detection, so you don't receive false alarms every time the neighbor's cat hangs out at your porch. If you are buying an outdoor security camera on a budget, at least make sure you get a camera with motion detection technology.
* **Ease of installation:** A camera with an easy installation process is better when you are not too handy and don't want to spend extra money on getting professional help. It is better to check what other customers write about the installation process; this way, you won't waste time or money.
* **Cost**: When you buy home surveillance systems, you should consider more than just the camera price. You might need to consider additional expenses like accessories, cloud storage monthly fees, mount bases, and even professional installation, if necessary.
* **Audio**: Many cameras have settings such as two-way audio to talk with visitors or even whoever delivers your packages. Be aware that although some cameras allow you to record audio, it may violate federal wiretapping laws unless proper signage is posted -- depending on your state.
* **Field of view**: The field of view refers to how much area the camera can cover from a single angle: the narrower the field, the better view angle and focal distance you will have. For outdoor cameras, we prefer a field of view without at least 110 degrees or higher.
* **Resolution**: The higher the resolution of the outdoor camera, the more internet bandwidth and space on the cloud or internal storage it will require.  A higher resolution will allow you to see much more details in the video, but you should consider if your internet service supports it and if you are willing to pay for a more expensive cloud storage service. We recommend going after a camera that offers at least 1080p in resolution.
* **Power source:**If the outdoor camera you choose is wired, installing it could present challenges that may require professional help to handle it. Battery-powered systems are usually easier to install and charge, but you will need to make sure to check the charge level periodically, so it doesn't stop working. Some cameras come with an app that allows you to monitor the battery for easier maintenance.       
  
### Outdoor camera accessories

Here are some accessories that your outdoor cameras will need to work in optimal conditions:


	+ **Camera base or mount**: When you buy an outdoor camera, you must check if the package includes the camera base or mount -- a must-have place to keep your camera on the best angle to capture your home surroundings.
	+ **Solar panel charger**: A solar panel charger will keep your camera's battery charged without needing to worry about running out of battery. If you are forgetful or want to make an eco-friendly decision, make sure you get one.
	+ **Subscriptions to cloud storage**: Cloud storage exists to keep your security videos and clips digitally safe. Some camera manufacturers offer limited to no cloud storage for free, so you will probably need a subscription to store and access your video feed remotely and use premium features.
	+ **Storage card**: If you choose a camera that allows you to add an internal storage card, remember to get the compatible card that supports it. Usually, when you get a reading card for your home surveillance system, you won't need to worry about extra cloud storage, although some features might still require you to get a subscription.
	+ **Camera cover**: If the camera you choose is not waterproof or water-resistant, you will need to get a camera cover. Another plus, if you get one, is that it will protect the equipment from hard weather conditions like sunlight and rain, giving it a longer life.
	+ **Strong internet connection**: We added a stable internet connection as an accessory since, if your camera equipment is going to be installed outside, you will need it to enjoy most of your camera's features. Without a stable internet connection, you will have delays on your two-way conversation and lags on your live streamings and motion detection notifications.Outdoor security camera FAQ
