There are plenty of VPNs out there, but they are not all created equal and very few of them even come close to offering the level of protection that NordVPN provides. You get unrestricted, completely private access to the internet regardless of whether you are on a cellular network, using public WiFi, or anywhere else. All of your data is protected by double encryption and travels through private tunnels, so your identity remains anonymous and all of your most sensitive personal information is securely hidden.

For maximum security, NordVPN will automatically disconnect you from the internet as soon as it no longer detects a connection to the company's servers, so not a scrap of your data will ever be revealed. NordVPN maintains the strictest no-logging policy, so you can rest assured that absolutely none of your online activity is recorded anywhere.

The platform offers almost 5,400 server locations around the world in almost 60 countries. That means you can also anonymously bypass geographical restrictions on content, to watch whatever you like, no matter where you happen to be. Best of all, you do not have to sacrifice speed for security, because your server connections are blazingly fast. So you'll get instant videos with no buffering.

There is no doubt whatsoever that NordVPN provides the ultimate protection, the service has gotten unbelievably impressive ratings from a wide range of sources. TechRadar gave it 4.5 out of 5 stars, while CNET, TrustPilot, and PCMag all gave it a perfect rating of 5 out of 5 stars.

Don't miss this chance to get two full years of powerful protection while it's heavily discounted. Get your 2-year subscription to NordVPN and $10 store credit today for just [$89](https://academy.zdnet.com/sales/nordvpn-2-yr-subscription-10-stacksocial-com-store-credit?utm_source=zdnet.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=nordvpn-2-yr-subscription-10-stacksocial-com-store-credit&utm_term=scsf-500344&utm_content=a0x1P000004fIpjQAE&scsonar=1), instead of the usual MSRP of $286.
