Our digital selves, more and more, are becoming part of our full identity. The emails we send, the conversations we have over social media -- both private and public -- as well as photos we share, the videos we watch, and the websites we visit all contribute to our digital personas. 


There are ways to prevent a government agency, country, or cybercriminals from peeking into our digital lives. [Virtual private networks](https://www.zdnet.com/article/what-is-a-vpn-and-how-does-it-work/) (VPNs), end-to-end encryption and using browsers that do not track user activity are all common methods. 

Sometimes, however, surveillance is more difficult to detect -- and closer to home.

Whereas spyware rarely singles out individuals, unless it is in the hands of law enforcement or unscrupulous government agencies, stalkerware is software that anyone can buy in order to spy on those closest to them.  
 






Stalkerware enables stealing images and text messages, eavesdropping on phone calls, and covertly recording conversations made over the internet. 

Stalkerware may be able to also intercept app communications made through Skype, Facebook, WhatsApp, and iMessage. 

Both terms, spyware and stalkerware, relate to similar malicious software functions. However, the latter is deemed more personal in use. 

In order to avoid potential legal issues and alienating clients, many spyware solutions providers will market their offerings as services for parents seeking a way to monitor their child's mobile device usage or for business owners to keep an eye on their staff's online activities during work hours.  

However, anyone willing to pay for the software can acquire it. 

Retina-X, makers of [PhoneSheriff](http://www.retinax.com/phonesheriff/), marketed their spyware software solution, for example, as "parental control for mobile." 

PhoneSheriff, developed for the Google Android operating system, permitted location monitoring via GPS, recorded calls, enabled access to text messages, and logged websites visited. The spyware was also able to block contacts, websites, and apps. 

The company, which also developed TeenShield, SniperSpy, and Mobile Spy, closed its doors after a hacktivist said they would "[burn them to the ground](https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/vvabv3/hackers-why-they-hit-stalkerware-flexispy-retina-x)." Retina-X [stopped taking orders](http://www.retinax.com/) for the software and offered pro-rated refunds to contracted users. 

When these types of software are used at home, there are few reasons which do not lean towards toxic relationships. With the evolution of technology, so too has domestic abuse changed. Sometimes, stalkerware is used to monitor partners and spouses covertly, or occasionally with the full knowledge of the victim. 

Spyware and stalkerware are found less commonly in the enterprise although some software solutions are marketed for companies to keep track of employee mobile devices and their activities. 

The lines here can be blurry, but if a mobile device belongs to a company and is used by a staff member in full knowledge that it is tracked or monitored, then this may be considered acceptable. In these cases, employees should keep their private lives, social media, and emails on their own smartphone or tablet and off company property. 

![screen-shot-2018-09-05-at-16-49-41.png]()![screen-shot-2018-09-05-at-16-49-41.png](https://www.zdnet.com/a/hub/i/r/2018/09/05/f0436d78-a0cf-482c-9bed-f8ccb5f547fd/resize/770xauto/7e46f9cbb1e2e4bd162eb0504758ae03/screen-shot-2018-09-05-at-16-49-41.png)* **[mSpy](https://www.mspy.com/):** Another stalkerware app which markets itself as a service for parents, mSpy for the iPhone allows users to monitor SMS messages, phone calls, GPS locations, apps including Snapchat and WhatsApp, and also includes a keylogger to record every keystroke made on the target device.
* **[PhoneSpector](https://phonespector.com/):** Designed for both Android and iOS handsets, PhoneSpector claims to offer "undetectable remote access." While a disclaimer says that the service is designed for parents and businesses seeking to track company-owned devices used by employees only, the implementation of the software is made through common tactics used by malware and phishing campaigns. "All you have to do is text or email the OTA (over-the-air) link to the target device and our automated system will set up data transfer protocol and the necessary info for you to monitor the device," the company proclaims. "Just tap a few buttons, then login to your online account! You can be viewing texts, calls, GPS and more within a few short minutes!"

**MobileTracker, FoneMonitor, Spyera**, **SpyBubble**, **Spyzie, Android Spy**, and **Mobistealth** are a few more examples of stalkerware which offer similar features, among many, many more in what has become a booming business. 

It is also worth noting that you can be tracked by legitimate software which has been abused. Whether or not GPS is turned on, some information recovery apps and services designed to track down a handset in the case of loss or theft can be turned against victims to track their location instead.

###  Removal of different brands

**[FlexiSpy removal](https://hackingninja.com/flexispy/how-to-remove-flexispy-on-iphone-or-android.html):** FlexiSpy may masquerade on Android devices under the name "SyncManager." If you find this app on your phone, try to uninstall it directly, and then restart your phone. However, it may also appear under another generic name, and so before deleting any apps, perform a search on the app name first. 

**mSpy:** To remove mSpy, instructions [are here](https://blog.mspy.com/how-to-remove-mspy-from-android/) as long as you have physical access to the device. On the iPhone, you need to access Cydia, search "Installed" and look for "IphoneInternalService." Press modify and remove. Additional options to try are [explained here](https://hackingninja.com/mspy/how-to-detect-and-remove-mspy-from-a-cell-phone.html). 

###  So, what are Google and Apple doing about the problem?

Both Google and Apple are generally quick off the mark if spyware or other forms of malicious apps manage to circumvent the privacy and security barriers imposed for applications hosted in their respective official app stores.  

In July 2019, Google [removed seven apps](https://www.zdnet.com/article/google-cleans-out-stalker-apps-from-play-store/) from the same Russian developer from the Play Store. While marketed as employee and child trackers, the tech giant took a dim view of their overreaching functions -- including GPS device tracking, access to SMS messages, the theft of contact lists, and potentially the exposure of communication taking place in messaging applications.  

When it comes to Apple, the iPad and iPhone maker [began a crackdown](https://www.zdnet.com/article/apple-refutes-anti-competitive-parent-control-app-claims-says-removal-was-for-security-user-privacy/) on parental control apps April 2019, citing privacy-invading functions as the reason for some iOS apps to be removed from the App Store. In some cases, Apple requested developers to remove functions, whereas, in others, the apps were simply removed. The company offers its own parental device control service called [Screen Time](https://www.cnet.com/how-to/ios-12-screen-time-and-stronger-parental-controls/) for parents that want to limit their children's device usage. 

Surveillance without consent is unethical and in domestic situations causes a severe imbalance in power. If your sixth sense says something is wrong, listen to it. 

A physical object is not worth sacrificing your privacy for. Should your device become compromised, take back control of your right to privacy -- whether or not this means replacing your handset entirely.
