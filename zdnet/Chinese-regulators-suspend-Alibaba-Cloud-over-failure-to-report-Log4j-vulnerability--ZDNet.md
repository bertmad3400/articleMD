Chinese media outlets have reported that Alibaba Cloud is facing backlash from government regulators after they reported the [Log4J vulnerability](https://www.zdnet.com/article/log4j-zero-day-flaw-what-you-need-to-know-and-how-to-protect-yourself/) to Apache before the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT).

[21st Century Business Herald said](https://m.21jingji.com/timestream/html/%7BU9Pjf0FaKEU=%7D) local reporters were informed on Wednesday that the Cyber Security Administration of the MIIT was suspending its information-sharing partnership with Alibaba Cloud for six months, specifically citing the failure to report Log4J as the reason why. 


Chen Zhaojun, a security engineer at Alibaba Cloud, was [identified by Bloomberg News](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-12-13/how-apache-raced-to-fix-a-potentially-disastrous-software-flaw) as the first person to discover the Log4J vulnerability and report it to Apache. Zhaojun told Apache on November 24 and a third party later informed the MIIT [in a report](https://www.miit.gov.cn/xwdt/gxdt/sjdt/art/2021/art_7587d13959e24aeb86887f7ef60d50d3.html) on December 9, [according to Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/world/china/china-regulator-suspends-cyber-security-deal-with-alibaba-cloud-2021-12-22/). 

"Recently, after discovering serious security vulnerabilities in the Apache Log4j2 component, Alibaba Cloud failed to report to the telecommunications authorities in a timely manner and did not effectively support the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology to carry out cyber security threats and vulnerability management," the local media report said. 

[The Protocol](https://www.protocol.com/bulletins/alibaba-cloud-log4j) noted that China recently put into effect a new law that makes it mandatory for all companies to report vulnerabilities to state regulators within two days.   

The Chinese government has sought to get a better handle on cybersecurity and [privacy](https://www.zdnet.com/article/chinas-personal-data-protection-law-kicks-in-today/) in recent months, passing multiple laws and [issuing warnings](https://www.zdnet.com/article/china-reportedly-warns-local-tech-companies-of-increased-cybersecurity-oversight/) to major companies about the need to protect data shared outside of China. 

Alibaba [was hit](https://www.zdnet.com/article/alibaba-slapped-with-record-2-7b-antitrust-fine/) with a record 18.2 billion yuan fine and 33 other mobile apps have [faced criticism](https://www.zdnet.com/article/china-calls-out-33-apps-for-collecting-more-user-data-than-necessary/) from Beijing for their data collection policies. Didi has [faced a major cybersecurity review](https://www.zdnet.com/article/didi-barred-from-china-appstores-amidst-government-cybersecurity-review/), while Alibaba and Tencent have come under [government scrutiny](https://www.zdnet.com/article/chinas-top-court-demands-greater-scrutiny-to-prevent-monopolies/) in recent months as well.  






In November, the Cyberspace Administration of China [unveiled a new set of laws](https://www.zdnet.com/article/china-looks-to-classify-online-data-in-draft-security-laws/) that reclassified data and laid out multiple sets of fines for violations of cybersecurity policy.
