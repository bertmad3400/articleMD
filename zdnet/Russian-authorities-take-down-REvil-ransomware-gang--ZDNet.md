The raids took place following requests from the United States, which has been a major victim of [ransomware attacks by REvil](https://www.zdnet.com/article/revil-ransomware-group-resurfaces-after-brief-hiatus/). 

Previous [action has been taken against REvil](https://www.zdnet.com/article/multiple-governments-involved-in-coordinated-takedown-of-revil-ransomware-group-reuters/), including [suspected members being arrested in Romania and Ukraine](https://www.zdnet.com/article/ransomware-suspected-revil-ransomware-affiliates-arrested/), but the raids by the FSB is the first time Russian authorities have taken action against the group.

One of the [most significant alleged R](https://www.zdnet.com/article/updated-kaseya-ransomware-attack-faq-what-we-know-now/)[Evil attacks targeted Kaseya](https://www.zdnet.com/article/updated-kaseya-ransomware-attack-faq-what-we-know-now/), an IT solutions developer for MSPs and enterprise clients. REvil was also accused of being responsible [for a major ransomware attack against food supplier JBS](https://www.zdnet.com/article/fbi-attributes-jbs-ransomware-attack-to-revil/), which [paid $11 million in Bitcoin](https://www.zdnet.com/article/ransomware-russia-told-to-tackle-cyber-criminals-operating-from-within-its-borders/) to the attackers in exchange for the key required to decrypt the network.






Last year, the [United States and other G7 countries warned Russia](https://www.zdnet.com/article/ransomware-russia-told-to-tackle-cyber-criminals-operating-from-within-its-borders/) that it needed to take responsibility for ransomware and other cyber criminal groups operating within its borders. [Ransomware has become one of the biggest cybersecurity issues facing the world today](https://www.zdnet.com/article/ransomware-in-2022-were-all-screwed/), with attacks against every sector resulting in disruption.

High-profile incidents have seen [hospitals and healthcare services](https://www.zdnet.com/article/irish-healthcare-ransomware-attack-three-quarters-of-servers-decrypted-but-disruption-to-services-will-continue-for-months/), [energy suppliers](https://www.zdnet.com/article/colonial-pipeline-paid-close-to-5-million-in-ransomware-blackmail-payment/) and [local governments](https://www.zdnet.com/article/albuquerque-public-schools-shut-down-by-ransomware-incident/) hit with ransomware attacks, preventing people from being able to access vital services they need.
