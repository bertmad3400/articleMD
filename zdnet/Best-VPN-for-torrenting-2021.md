BitTorrent is a complex topic. As a technology, it's perfectly legal. But what you do with it could be illegal.

Before we dive into the legalities of torrenting, let's do a quick recap of what BitTorrent is and how it works. Fundamentally, BitTorrent is a peer-to-peer (P2P) file-sharing network and protocol. But what does that mean? Well, normally when you download a file, you're pulling all the bits from one server. If that server has limited bandwidth, the number of people downloading might be quite limited. 

BitTorrent splits that up. Files on the BitTorrent network are scattered in pieces among "seeders" (computers that host the full file) and downloaders, so when someone downloads a file, they're pulling pieces of that file from many different machines. That's the peer-to-peer component of torrenting. You're not just pulling from one central server; you're pulling from other users (peers) on the torrent network. 

Why would you do this? For smaller files, torrenting is not important. But for really big files, torrenting helps distribute the load among users. And what are big files? Video. A two-hour HD movie uses up to about 8GB. A TV series could use upwards of 80GB per season of the show. Other big files are software distributions, like Linux distros, games, large images, and big datasets. 

The problem is that most often, BitTorrent is used to share video. And most often, BitTorrent is used to share copyrighted video like popular movies and TV shows. And the problem with that is that doing so is illegal in most jurisdictions. And that is how we come back to VPNs, because while VPNs can protect your usage and location for legitimate reasons, VPNs can also facilitate illegal activity. 

This has not gone unnoticed by movie studios and other victims of digital piracy. In May, [a case](https://www.law.com/2021/06/21/brownstein-hyatt-tapped-to-defend-data-center-operator-against-claims-of-enabling-movie-copyright-infringement/?slreturn=20210920072409) assigned to U.S. District Judge S. Kato Crews, 1:21-cv-01261, *Millennium Funding, Inc. et al v. Sharktech, Inc. et* al was filed against an Internet hosting provider that operated servers for a number of VPN firms. [According to TorrentFreak](https://torrentfreak.com/vpn-hosting-company-settles-copyright-lawsuit-by-blocking-pirate-sites-211008/), the parties settled for an undisclosed sum just this month. 

[Another case](https://torrentfreak.com/images/vpn-movie-suit.pdf), Case 1:21-cv-00643-RDA-MSN, filed in Virginia pits various movie studios against VPN companies ExpressVPN, Surfshark, VPN Unlimited (another name for the owners of ExpressVPN, according to the complaint), and Zenmate. This complaint not only targets illegal downloading of content, but also specifically cites examples of VPNs used to facilitate trade in child pornography including *United States of America v. Frank Richard Beyer,* 0:19-cr-60360-RAR, where Beyer admitted to using ExpressVPN for his heinous and disgusting acts. 






We had an internal debate about the ethics of even writing an article about using VPNs for torrenting. But as I said at the beginning of this article, it's not the technology itself that's illegal. The illegality is in how some users use it. 

And so, we're providing you with a list of four of the more popular VPN services that can be used for torrenting. We explicitly do not endorse the use of torrenting, but because BitTorrent is as valid for sharing legitimate software and video distribution from open source and copyright-free providers, we feel that sharing this is a necessary part of our coverage, especially now that you understand some of the issues involved. 

And with that, here are four such services.
