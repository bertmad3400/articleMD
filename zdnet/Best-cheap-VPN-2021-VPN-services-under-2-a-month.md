One of the questions I'm asked most often by readers is: Why do VPNs have to be so expensive? Many of these folks say they loath to add yet another fee to their monthly bills or that they are operating on a limited budget. 

**Must read:**[**The best free VPNs: Why they don't exist**](https://www.zdnet.com/article/the-best-free-vpns-why-they-dont-exist/) 


Many have read [my advice about staying away from free VPNs](https://www.zdnet.com/article/the-best-free-vpns-why-they-dont-exist/) because it's unclear how those vendors make their money or even whether or not your data is being mined as it's transiting across the free VPN providers' networks. 

So, they understand it's better when VPN vendors make their money from their customers rather than from shadowy marketing or even criminal enterprises. That said, some of my readers have asked me whether there are cheap VPN providers we can recommend. 

Yes, with some caveats. First, what is "cheap?" For some folks, cheap might be under $10 per month. While for others, cheap is under a buck. Since I didn't find any VPN deals for less than a dollar a month, I'm arbitrarily defining "cheap" as less than $2 per month. 

At that price point, we're entering something of uncharted space. I'm going to "recommend" 4 services that are all between $1 and $2 a month. The gotcha is that I haven't tested any of these services, and I haven't found much in the way of in-depth reviews other than listings in "best of" lists. So, [you pays your money and you takes your chance](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/dictionary/english/you-pays-your-money-and-you-takes-your-choice-chance). 

With that caution out of the way, let's take a little walk on the wild side.   






So there you go. Four VPNs that cost less than $2 per month when you buy 2 or 3 years at once. If you have room in your budget or you want to learn more about the benefits of VPN, see my complete guide:  [Best VPN 2021: Top VPNs reviewed and compared](https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-vpn/).
