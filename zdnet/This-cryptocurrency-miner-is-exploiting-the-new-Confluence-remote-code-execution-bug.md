The z0Miner cryptojacker is now weaponizing a new Confluence vulnerability to mine for cryptocurrency on vulnerable machines. 


Trend Micro researchers [said on Tuesday](https://www.trendmicro.com/en_us/research/21/i/cryptominer-z0miner-uses-newly-discovered-vulnerability-cve-2021.html) that the cryptocurrency [mining malware](https://s.tencent.com/research/report/1170.html) is now exploiting a recently-disclosed Atlassian Confluence remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability, which was only made [public in August](https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/CONFSERVER-67940) this year.  

Tracked as [CVE-2021-26084](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-26084), the vulnerability impacts Confluence server versions 6.6.0, 6.13.0, 7.4.0, and 7.12.0.  

Issued a CVSS severity score of 9.8, the critical security flaw is an Object-Graph Navigation Language (ONGL) injection vulnerability that can be exploited to trigger RCE -- and is known to be actively exploited in the wild.  

The vulnerability was reported by Benny Jacob through Atlassian's bug bounty program. 

z0Miner, a Trojan and cryptocurrency [mining bundle](https://blog.netlab.360.com/threat-alert-z0miner-is-spreading-quickly-by-exploiting-elasticsearch-and-jenkins-vulnerabilities/), has been updated to exploit the RCE, as well as Oracle's WebLogic Server RCE (CVE-2020-14882) an ElasticSearch RCE (CVE-2015-1427), Jenkins, and other code execution bugs in popular server software.   

Once a vulnerable server has been found and the vulnerability has been used to obtain remote access, the malware will deploy a set of webshells to install and execute malicious files, including a .dll file disguised as a Hyper-V integration service, as well as a scheduled task that pretends to be a legitimate .NET Framework NGEN task.  






The task will attempt to download and execute malicious scripts from a repository on Pastebin, but as of now, the URL has been pulled.  

These initial actions are aimed at maintaining persistence on an infected machine. In its second-stage payload deployment, z0Miner will then scan and destroy any competing cryptocurrency miners installed on the server, before launching its own -- a miner that steals computing resources to generate Monero (XMR). 

A patch has been released to resolve CVE-2021-26084, and as threat actors will always seek to exploit new bugs for their own ends -- the [Microsoft Exchange Server](https://www.zdnet.com/article/everything-you-need-to-know-about-microsoft-exchange-server-hack/) attacks being a prime example -- vulnerable systems should always be updated with new security fixes as quickly as possible by IT administrators.
