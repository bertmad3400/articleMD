Hardly a week goes by when we don't hear of a data breach, an exposed AWS bucket leaking the records of millions of people, or a serious cybersecurity incident that gives IT teams sleepless nights and prompts government agencies to issue alerts to warn the enterprise of new threats. 

Two incidents alone in 2021 -- the Microsoft Exchange Server vulnerabilities debacle and the ransomware attack against the Colonial pipeline, which supplies 45% of the East Coast's fuel -- have highlighted the need for cybersecurity experts to protect both enterprise resources and core, critical services, and infrastructure. 

The industry does not necessarily demand certifications to get started, but there are options available to give you a thorough grounding in different concepts, explore different areas in the field to pursue, and deepen your knowledge and expertise. 

Below, we have listed the best options to get you started and to stand out when you apply for a role in this lucrative field.
