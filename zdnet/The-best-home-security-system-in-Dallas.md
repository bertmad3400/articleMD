Home security in Dallas: What you need to know
----------------------------------------------

### Dallas, Texas, crime statistics

Your city's [overall crime rate and common types of crimes](https://www.neighborhoodscout.com/tx/dallas/crime) can provide better insight into how to keep your home safe. However, keep in mind that crime stats only offer a piece of the entire puzzle. In Dallas, Texas, the crime rate is twice as high as the national rate, which is understandable given how large a city it is. Unfortunately, in Dallas, you have a 1 in 29 chance of becoming the victim of a property crime. 

Here are a few more statistics to bear in mind:

* 34 out of 1000 residents of Dallas are victims of property crimes
* Nearly 7 out of 1000 people in Dallas will experience a burglary
* 20 out of 1000 people in Dallas will experience a theft

### Research your neighborhood

The type of home security system you'll need will depend on what kind of neighborhood you live in. Be sure to research your neighborhood to see how likely it is that you'll experience a crime and what kind of crimes are common in your area. If you live in a low-crime neighborhood, you may only need a basic security setup. However, if burglary is a concern where you live, you may want to consider a complete home security package. Most of the safest neighborhoods like Hillcrest Road/Spring Valley Road, Northaven Road/Hillcrest Road, Northaven Road/Inwood Road, Northaven Road/Preston Road are located in northern Dallas. Areas like Sargent and Fruitdale, however, have lower safety ratings. 

To learn more about how to research your neighborhood's safety record, browse our resources [here](https://www.reviews.com/home/security-systems/online-neighborhood-safety/).

### Register your home security system in Dallas






It's important to register your home security system with the city of Dallas because, if it's not, the city can refuse to respond to your home alarms. Keeping a record of the Security Alarm Permits helps the city keep the registration information up-to-date. Hence, law enforcement knows how to reach you should your alarm go off and you're not home, and it lets the city of Dallas keep track of false alarms. The first three times you spark a false alarm in Dallas, you will not be charged a fee. After that, the fourth, fifth, and sixth false alarms will cost you $50. For the seventh and eighth false alarms, you'll be charged $75 and $100 from then on. 

In order to register for a [Security Alarm Permit](https://dallascityhall.com/departments/waterutilities/special_collections/Pages/special_collections_registrations.aspx) with the city of Dallas, follow these instructions:

1. Visit [False Alarm Reduction Website (dallasalarmpermit.com)](https://www.dallasalarmpermit.com/)
2. Click "Register Online"
3. Fill out the online registration form, which will require your contact information, address, and alarm company information
4. Pay the $50 fee
5. For more information, visit [Home (dallaspolice.net)](https://www.dallaspolice.net/)

How to choose your Dallas home security system
----------------------------------------------

* **Interior/exterior cameras:** If you're going to purchase a security camera for your home, consider the weather ratings for exterior cameras. Dallas is hot and humid, with warm summers and mild winters. Since Dallas is exposed to such extreme weather conditions, you'll want to make sure the camera you install outside your home is rated for your specific climate.
* **Control panel:**The control panel is one of the most important facets of your home security system. This is the interface that gives you access to the backend of your home security system. Before you purchase a security system for your home, research how intuitive and easy to use the control panel is. You won't want to find yourself with a complicated control panel while frantically trying to turn off your home's security alarm.
* **Compatibility:**One of the most convenient aspects of a home security system is its compatibility with your smart devices. The top operating systems for phones, Android, Google, and iOS, should integrate with most home security system hubs. Before choosing a home security system, research to make sure the software, usually an app, will work with your phone or any other smart devices you own.
* **Storage:**If you live in an area where you're bombarded with foot traffic, you might stock up on video storage a lot more quickly than you would expect should you have a motion-sensor camera. If this is the case, be sure to position the camera to focus on the traffic that's coming in and out of your home instead of the street. This will help to cut down on needless monitoring and keep you from racking up unnecessary video footage.
* **Window/door sensors:**Due to Dallas's considerable humidity, you'll want to make sure your door and window sensors are weatherproofed. With long-term exposure, the dense humidity and heat could cause a lot of wear and tear on any outdoor sensors. Ideally, you'll want to keep your window and door sensors indoors.

**Local vs. national companies**



| **Pros of local security company**

 | It offers a more personalized experience  
 Familiarity with your neighborhood  
 Investment in your community

 |
| **Cons of local security company**

 | Pricier packages  
 Longer wait times  
 Less resources to offer

 |
| **Pros of national security company**

 | 24/7 monitoring  
 Wide variety of equipment options  
 Smart equipment capabilities

 |
| **Cons of national security company**

 | Poor customer service  
 Less personalized experience  
 Lack of familiarity with your neighborhood

 |

Methodology
-----------

We evaluated home security companies based on equipment cost, monthly costs, contract options, installation and customer satisfaction to determine Reviews.com scores and create our best home security reviews. To compare home security companies with other providers across the board, we calculate each Reviews.com score based on the following:

* **Monthly price**: The lower the cost of a home security company's monthly contract, the higher the score. Inversely, the higher the cost of the monthly contract, the lower the score in this metric.
* **Equipment cost**: Affordability is important with home security, so we awarded higher scores to home security companies with lower equipment prices.
* **Contracts**: Reviews.com reviewed the flexibility in contracts of the home security companies. The more flexibility, like having no contracts to bind customers for long periods, the higher the score.
* **Customer satisfaction**: With J.D. Power's [2020 Home Security Satisfaction Study](https://www.jdpower.com/business/press-releases/2020-home-security-satisfaction-study), we assigned a score to each company based on the rating it received.
* **Installation**: Like with contracts, we award higher scores to companies with flexible installation options, like DIY or professional options.
