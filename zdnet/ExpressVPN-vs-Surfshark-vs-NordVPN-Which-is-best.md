In our [best of guide](https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-vpn/) and [speed test guide](https://www.zdnet.com/article/fastest-vpn/), we've narrowed down the list from the wide array of branded commercial options out there to about 10. But that is still a lot to dig through. Which do you choose? In this article, we've taken three of our top choices -- ExpressVPN, Surfshark, and NordVPN -- and compared their characteristics.

This isn't a one-size-fits-all competition. You'll need to decide which factors matter most to you, and from that, you can choose which product you want to test out. Keep in mind that all three products offer trial periods. We strongly encourage you to take advantage of that period to see which performs best in all of the likely situations where you'll be using a VPN. 

And with that, let's dive in. 

How do these choices fit your needs? Have you chosen a VPN provider already? What capabilities and characteristics helped you to make up your mind.
