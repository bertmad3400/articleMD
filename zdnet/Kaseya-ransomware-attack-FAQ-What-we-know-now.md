Kaseya, an IT solutions developer for MSPs and enterprise clients, announced that it had become the victim of a cyberattack on July 2, over the American Independence Day weekend.  


It appears that attackers have carried out a supply chain ransomware attack by leveraging a vulnerability in Kaseya's VSA software against multiple managed service providers (MSP) -- and their customers.

According to Kaseya CEO Fred Voccola, less than 0.1% of the company's customers were embroiled in the breach -- but as their clientele includes MSPs, this means that smaller businesses have also been caught up in the incident.  

Present estimates suggest that 800 to [1500 small to medium-sized companies](https://www.zdnet.com/article/kaseya-ransomware-attack-1500-companies-affected-company-confirms/) may have experienced a ransomware compromise through their MSP.  

The attack is reminiscent of the [SolarWinds security fiasco](https://www.zdnet.com/article/solarwinds-the-more-we-learn-the-worse-it-looks/), in which attackers managed to compromise the vendor's software to push a malicious update to thousands of customers. However, we are yet to find out just how widespread Kaseya's ransomware incident will prove to be.  

Here is everything we know so far. ZDNet will update this primer as we learn more.

Kaseya CEO Fred Voccola said that the attack, "for the very small number of people who have been breached, it totally sucks." 

"We are two days after this event," Voccola commented. "We have about 150 people that have probably slept a grand total of four hours in the last two days, literally, and that'll continue until everything is as perfect as can be." 

Less than 0.1% of the company's customers experienced a breach. 

"Unfortunately, this happened, and it happens," the executive added. "Doesn't make it okay. It just means it's the way the world we live in is today."
