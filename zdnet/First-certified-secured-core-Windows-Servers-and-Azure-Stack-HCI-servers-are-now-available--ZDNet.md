Earlier this year, Microsoft announced plans for secured-core servers, the server complements to [secured-core PCs](https://www.zdnet.com/article/windows-10-security-microsoft-reveals-secured-core-to-block-firmware-attacks/). Today, December 7, the [first servers that have passed the "Secured-core" standards bar](https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/2021/12/07/new-secured-core-servers-are-now-available-from-the-microsoft-ecosystem-to-help-secure-your-infrastructure/) are available to customers.   
   
Customers interested in the new secured-core servers can find listings for them in the Windows Server and Azure Stack HCI catalogs. [HPE's Gen 10 Plus (v2) products for Azure Stack HCI 21H2](https://hcicatalog.azurewebsites.net/#/catalog?FeatureSupported=securedCoreServer) get the secured-core designation. Dell, HPE, Lenovo, AMD and NEC have a variety of server products running Windows Server 2016, 2019 and/or 2022 that [get the secure-core checkmark](https://www.windowsservercatalog.com/results.aspx?&bCatID=1333&cpID=0&avc=10&ava=0&avt=0&avq=140&OR=1&PGS=25&PG=1).  
   
Secured-core servers use the Trusted Platform Module (TPM) 2.0 and secure boot to make sure only trusted components load in the boot path.   
   
Secured-core servers, as the name implies, are designed to help protect against threats that commonly targete servers, such as ransomware and exploits around cryptocurrency mining. Secured-core servers protect server infrastructure with a hardware root of trust; defend sensitive workloads against firmware-level attacks and prevent access and execution of unverified code on systems, Microsoft officials said.
