Customer service
----------------

### ADT

ADT has been accredited with the Better Business Bureau since 2013, and the company has been in business for more than 130 years. While it does earn an A+ rating from the BBB, its average customer review score isn't so glowing at just one star out of five. In addition, the company has had more than 3000 complaints filed against it in the last three years. But it's not all bad news for ADT -- the company ranks second in the J.D. Power 2019 Home Security Satisfaction Study for professionally installed security systems with an overall score of 847 and three power circles out of five.

ADT also offers a host of online support options, including live chat and the ability to connect through popular social media platforms, including Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter. Customers can also get in touch by phone 24/7/365.



---

### Ring

Ring earns top marks from the J.D. Power Home Security Satisfaction Study for DIY security systems with an overall score of 904 and 5 power circles out of 5. The company is also accredited by the BBB but only earned accreditation this year. Ring does get an A+ rating from the BBB and has a better average customer review score at 1.25 stars out of five, but it's only been in business for six years.

Ring also offers live chat and an in-depth online knowledge base, and the company's mobile application is well-reviewed for both Android and iOS devices.

Ease of installation
--------------------

### ADT

All ADT installations are done professionally and cost between $99 and $199. If you're a prequalified customer -- which means you've passed a soft credit check -- the installation fee may be waived. Depending on where you live, ADT may offer same-day installation if you purchase your security system package before 2 p.m., but in most cases, you'll need to wait until the next day.

System configurations can be customized to your needs, and you'll be provided instructions on how to arm, disarm, and monitor your equipment. ADT also offers a six-month money-back guarantee if you're not satisfied with your new system.



---

### Ring

Ring does not offer professional installation -- everything is DIY. The company claims that setup is easy and could take as little as 15 minutes, and for the most part, this is accurate. Many of its sensors and other wireless devices are peel-and-stick, and all system packages include a range extender to ensure all devices connect reliably.

Once you've found the ideal position for your Ring devices, most are easy to get up and running by simply plugging them in or installing their batteries. The only exception here is the Ring Video Doorbell, which requires removing your existing doorbell and wiring in the new device. Ring does offer video tutorials on its website, but if you're unsure about wiring your own system, it's worth contacting a professional electrician. While Ring offers only a 30-day refund policy for their systems, it does offer a one-year warranty on their devices.
