I recently had a friendly discussion with a marketing guy who contended that the term "small business" didn't apply to home-based businesses because small businesses have between a hundred and 1,500 employees and revenues from about $1M to about $40M. Technically, if you accept the US Small Business Administration's very wrong-headed [definition of small business](https://www.census.gov/library/stories/2021/01/what-is-a-small-business.html), that's correct. But I defy you to tell a small restaurant owner or an IT consultant with five or ten employees that their business isn't a small business. Afterall, [roughly 54% of employer businesses](https://www.census.gov/library/stories/2021/01/what-is-a-small-business.html) (business with employees) are smaller than the SBA's definition of small business. 


This is even more the case in these times of Covid. Many employees are working from home, whether or not they're employed by companies with huge or tiny payrolls. But the distinction is important -- and this is what my marketing friend was getting at -- because if you look at tiny businesses, they tend to need different networking infrastructure than so-called small businesses the size of small departments or divisions. 

For our purposes, specifically for this article, we're looking at VPN solutions that can fit businesses operating from homes as well as small offices. Two of them, NordLayer and Perimeter 81, can scale to larger small businesses. The other two, Surfshark and ExpressVPN, have tools that help small business owners manage multiple subscriptions and licenses. Let's take a look. 

###  How we choose

Finding the right participants for this list was an interesting exercise. I wanted to stay away from the larger-scale corporate VPN solutions because anything that requires a special certification or multiple full-time IT people was for larger businesses than I was trying to reach in this article. So everything had to be reasonably deployable by an experienced tech user, not a formally-trained and certified IT professional. 

Second, everything had to have some kind of unified billing. It didn't make sense to call something a business plan if you had to make 10 individual credit card payments each month for your ten employees' VPN accounts. While the checkout mechanism for ExpressVPN and Surfshark do not offer unified billing, both companies advised us that you can contact them and they'll set up account management services for multiple accounts. 

And, finally, we've been testing most of these products for going on years now. While I don't use any one VPN constantly, I have run most of these through my testing process, and the results are provided along with the recommendation. 

###  How you should choose

Keep in mind that everyone's needs are different and VPNs are particularly challenging because your performance is determined by the country you're in, your ISP, your connection, and even the current weather conditions. I always recommend choosing vendors with a liberal refund policy (at least 30 days), and test, test, test to see if the service performs as you need it to. 






Beyond that, keep an eye out for any egregious renewal pricing and conditions. Most of the vendors I spotlight either don't have renewal fees that slam you after a few years or, if they do, I point them out so you can watch out for them. 

One more thing I recommend is you start a dialog with the various customer and tech support teams. If you're running your company on these services, find out how responsive and communicative they are.
