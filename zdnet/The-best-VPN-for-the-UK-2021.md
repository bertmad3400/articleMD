 Why picking a good VPN can make your life better
-------------------------------------------------

Consumer Virtual Private Networks (VPN) have become increasingly important for people who want to stay safe online, whether it's for work, entertainment, or when passing through airports and cafes with free wifi.  

There has been a boom in VPN adoption in recent years. While employees have been using VPN to securely tunnel into a corporate network for decades, Edward Snowden's 2013 NSA leaks made more people jittery about mass surveillance. Russia's and China's recent bans on VPNs show how contentious the technology has become for governments. A raft of national security laws, such as the UK's 2016 Investigatory Powers Bill, also spurred interest in consumer VPNs. 


Anyone with the know-how can set up their own VPN with a remote virtual machine in the cloud for about $10 a month in one location, but many people want a VPN to access content in different regions, which makes price, speed, locations, and server capacity important. Mainstream consumer VPN services let average computer users create a secure point-to-point encrypted tunnel through which data can travel and can shield metadata, such as a home computer's IP address.   

If you're paying a monthly fee for a VPN, it should work like any utility, humming in the background without noticeably disrupting downloads and uploads.   

For me, as a tech news reporter based in Europe, I find a VPN useful when I need to check out Google's US Chromebook and Pixel pricing to see products and prices that are not immediately available in the UK, Europe or Australia.  

So a VPN has many diverse functions. A major drawcard for consumer VPNs is that many people just don't like content being geo-blocked by Hulu, Amazon, Google, and Apple. You also might be a resident of the UK who travelled abroad and now can't see premier league football matches, some BBC content or shows only available on Netflix's UK service.  

But picking a VPN provider is tricky because consumers need to trust the VPN provider is protecting data as claimed.  






That's where third-party audits come into play and may help identify lemons. Nearly all VPN providers claim not to log user data and suggest their location of operation will prevent law enforcement from Five Eyes nations acquiring data. Not all subject their products to a third-party audit.  

All my VPN speed tests were carried out through Ookla's SpeedTest.net from a home fibre broadband connection just outside of Stockholm. I generally experience non-VPN download speeds of 70 Mbps and slightly faster upload speeds around 80 Mbps. Latency is normally about 3-5ms without a VPN.
