It may seem like overkill to go for a doorbell with Internet connectivity, video and audio feeds, and the ability to check-in remotely, but once you get used to the convenience of being able to chat to visitors and delivery staff no matter where you are, you will appreciate their value.&nbsp; Convenience, however, is just one benefit, as these types of products can be a useful security addition too, as you can clearly see visitors before opening the door, as well as deter potentially unwanted 'visitors' checking out your home.&nbsp; The Ring Video Doorbell Pro 2 is one of the latest products added to the range and boasts \"3D\" motion detection, HD+ video capture, Alexa integration, and \"Head to Toe\" front monitoring. The camera can be self-installed using an included plate.

You don't need to spend a fortune on making your home office secure, and thanks to mobile technology, our options are now far beyond a locked door and window fastenings.  

Smart video doorbells that record both video and audio feeds in real-time when you have a visitor; motion and sound sensors that can be used in and outside, digital door locks, cameras with excellent night vision -- the range of products that leverage mobile connectivity, apps, and Internet of Things (IoT) sensors are endless and are improving every year thanks to data analytics and the cloud.  

That is not to say that all smart home security products are created equal, and not every home needs to have costly setups when it comes to security -- sometimes, a few select pieces can create a home ecosystem that is enough to protect your home (and office) against intruders and alert you when suspicious activity is detected.  

*ZDNet* has created a list of recommendations suiting a variety of budgets and setups to help homeowners and remote workers decide how best to protect their properties, ranging from full kits to useful window sensors and cameras suitable for use both in and outdoors.
