# Best VPN for streaming: Fire Stick, Netflix & more
### One of the most popular uses for VPNs is getting around streaming restrictions. Is this legal? Not so much. But is it heavily promoted? You bet. Do we endorse the practice? No way. We're just here to educate, not endorse the practice of doing it.

 This is a sensitive topic. Owners of entertainment content go to great lengths to control the distribution of their wares, especially when it comes to international markets for movies and TV, and even local regions for black-out sporting events. By contrast, VPN vendors go to great lengths making the case that you can use their services to bypass all those restrictions.Â  

But there are times where, legally, you might want to use a VPN to watch a movie or video. If you're traveling, you can VPN back to your home country and use your home streaming service account to watch your favorite show. That said, it is, at best, a legally gray area. 

VPNs and set-top boxes and streaming sticks don't all work together well. The exception to this is the [Amazon Fire TVs](https://www.amazon.com/Amazon-Fire-TV-Family/?tag=zdnet-deals-20) and [Fire TV Sticks](https://www.amazon.com/Fire-TV-Stick-4K-with-Alexa-Voice-Remote/dp/B079QHML21/?tag=zdnet-deals-20), and any [Android TV box](https://www.amazon.com/Android-Streaming-Device-Allwinner-Bluetooth/dp/B08SHM9QBG/?tag=zdnet-deals-20). The [XGIMI Halo projector I recently spotlighted in an outdoor theatre project](https://www.zdnet.com/article/avoid-movie-crowds-meet-the-pandemic-drive-in-for-your-back-yard/) is one such device. But, if you're using a Roku, and Apple TV box, or any smart TV not running Android TV, you're forced to jump through a bunch of hoops, connecting your router up as a VPN, or connecting your TV as a client to your Mac or PC and using that machine's VPN-protected network. 

Honestly, if you want to watch streaming TV through a VPN, just get a [Fire TV stick](https://www.amazon.com/Fire-TV-Stick-4K-with-Alexa-Voice-Remote/dp/B079QHML21/?tag=zdnet-deals-20) and be done with it. It's the easiest and least expensive path.
