Your identity, as well as all of your most confidential personal information, is hidden with the utmost secrecy, thanks to NordVPN's private tunnels and double encryption.

For the ultimate security, if you happen to become disconnected from NordVPN servers, then your internet connection will be automatically dropped. That prevents even a scrap of data being revealed accidentally. And you can be absolutely sure that your online activity is not recorded anywhere whatsoever because NordVPN has an extremely strict no-logging policy.

Since you will have access to 5,400 server locations in nearly 60 countries around the world, you will also be able to anonymously slide right by all geographical restrictions that are placed on the content you might be interested in. So you can watch whatever you want, wherever you are, any time you please. Most importantly, NordVPN connections are lightning quick, which means you'll see videos instantly, without any buffering.
