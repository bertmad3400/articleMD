Security researchers have discovered new remote access trojan (RAT) malware that has created an unusual new way of hiding on servers.

As [first reported on BleepingComputer](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/new-linux-malware-hides-in-cron-jobs-with-invalid-dates/), this new malware, dubbed CronRAT, hides in scheduled tasks on Linux servers by being set for execution on February 31, a date that doesn't exist. 


Discovered and named by e-commerce security specialist Sansec, CronRAT is part of a growing trend in Linux server-focused Magecart malware. CronRAT is used to enable server-side Magecart data theft.

The security company describes the malware as "sophisticated" and it remains undetected by [most antivirus vendors](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/b46e51a2e757f4d75f1a1fff1165c6a0503b687db6c7e672021dcaa9bedf2d88/detection). Sansec had to rewrite its detection engine to spot the malware after receiving samples of it to discover how it works. 

The name CronRAT is a reference to the Linux cron tool that allows admins to create scheduled jobs on a Linux system to occur on a specific time of day or a regular day of the week.   

"CronRAT's main feat is hiding in the calendar subsystem of Linux servers ("cron") on a nonexistant day. This way, it will not attract attention from server administrators. And many security products do not scan the Linux cron system," [explain Sansec in a blogpost](https://sansec.io/research/cronrat). 






The malware drops a "sophisticated Bash program that features self-destruction, timing modulation and a custom binary protocol to communicate with a foreign control server," says Sansec. 

Magecart card skimmers are a problem that's not going away any time soon as e-commerce continues to play a vital role in shopping during the ongoing pandemic. Ahead of Black Friday, the [National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) warned](https://www.zdnet.com/article/hackers-targeted-thousands-of-online-retailers-to-steal-credit-card-details/) it had found 4,151 retailers that had been compromised by hackers targeting bugs in checkout pages over the past 18 months. Most of the attacks targeted bugs in popular e-commerce platform Magento. The FBI last year [issued a similar warning about Magecart attackers](https://www.zdnet.com/article/fbi-warns-about-attacks-on-magento-online-stores-via-old-plugin-vulnerability/) targeting a Magento plugin.
