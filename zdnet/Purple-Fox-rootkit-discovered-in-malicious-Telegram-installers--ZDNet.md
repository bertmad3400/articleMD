The Purple Fox rootkit is now being distributed through malicious, fake Telegram installers online, researchers have warned. 


This week, the [Minerva Labs](https://blog.minerva-labs.com/malicious-telegram-installer-drops-purple-fox-rootkit) cybersecurity team, working with MalwareHunterTeam, said that Purple Fox is being disguised through a file named "Telegram Desktop.exe." Those that believe they are installing the popular messaging service are, instead, becoming laden with the malware -- and the infection process has made it more difficult to detect. 

First discovered in 2018, Purple Fox has been spread through a variety of means including phishing emails, malicious links, and exploit kits. However, in the past few years, distribution methods have expanded to include compromising vulnerable internet-facing services, exposed SMB services, and fake installers.  

The malicious Telegram installer has been developed as a compiled AutoIt script. Upon execution, a legitimate Telegram installer is dropped – but never used – together with a malicious downloader called TextInputh.exe.  

The attack is then separated into several small files, a technique that Minerva says allowed the threat actor to stay under the radar – and most of the files "had very low detection rates by AV engines, with the final stage leading to Purple Fox rootkit infection." 

TextInputh.exe creates a new folder and connects to the malware's command-and-control (C2) server. Two new files are then downloaded and executed which unpack .RAR archives and a file used to reflectively load a malicious .DLL. 

A registry key is created to enable persistence on an infected machine and five further files are dropped into the ProgramData folder to perform functions including shutting down a wide range of antivirus processes before Purple Fox is finally deployed. 






The Purple Fox Trojan comes in both 32-bit and 64-bit Windows variants. In March last year, [Guardicore Labs](https://www.zdnet.com/article/purple-fox-malware-evolves-to-propagate-across-windows-machines/) found new worm capabilities had been integrated into the malware and thousands of vulnerable servers had been hijacked to host Purple Fox payloads.  

By October, [Trend Micro](https://www.trendmicro.com/en_us/research/21/j/purplefox-adds-new-backdoor-that-uses-websockets.html) uncovered a new .net backdoor, dubbed FoxSocket, which is believed to be a new addition to the malware's existing capabilities.  

Given that the malware now contains a rootkit, worm functionality, and has been upgraded with a more robust backdoor, the inclusion of a stealthier infection process means that cybersecurity researchers will likely be keeping a close eye on this malware's future development.  

"The beauty of this attack is that every stage is separated to a different file which are useless without the entire file set," the team noted. "This helps the attacker protect his files from AV detection."
