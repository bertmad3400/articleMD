 A heap overflow vulnerability has been discovered that  reportedly affects multiple distributions. Thankfully, a patch for this Linux Kernel bug is available which users should ensure they deploy ASAP.

 Heap Overflow Bug In Linux Kernel
---------------------------------

 A serious security vulnerability, CVE-2022-0185, recently came into the limelight after researchers found it existing for several years. This flaw has attained a high-severity rating and a CVSS score of 7.8.

 Reportedly, the vulnerability [made its way](https://latesthackingnews.com/2021/05/04/a-now-patched-linux-kernel-vulnerability-could-lead-to-data-leaks/) into the Linux Kernel version 5.1-rc1 back in 2019. Since then, it remained unpatched, and hence, affected numerous (rather all) distributions since February 2019.

 Specifically, William Liu, a [Linux Kernel](https://latesthackingnews.com/2016/09/15/linux-kernel-explained-laymans-terms/) developer, recently found a heap overflow bug in the Kernel. As [elaborated](https://seclists.org/oss-sec/2022/q1/54), this vulnerability affected the `legacy_parse_param` in the Filesystem Context system (`fs/fs_context.c`) program. Typically, this program is used during superblock creation for mounting and remounting storage blocks.

 Describing this vulnerability, the researcher stated,

 
> “There is a heap overflow bug in legacy\_parse\_param in which the length of data copied can be incremented beyond the width of the 1-page slab allocated for it…  
>  The bug is caused by an integer underflow present in fs/fs\_context.c:legacy\_parse\_param, which results in miscalculation of a valid max length. A bounds check is present at fs\_context.c:551, returning an error if (len > PAGE\_SIZE – 2 – size); however, if the value of size is greater than or equal to 4095, the unsigned subtraction will underflow to a massive value greater than len, so the check will not trigger. After this, the attacker may freely write data out-of-bounds.

 Patch Available
---------------

 The researcher developed functional local privilege escalation exploits against Ubuntu 20.04, and container escape exploits against Google’s hardened COS.

 Nonetheless, given the years-old existence of the flaw, it potentially risked all Linux distros.

 Fortunately, following its discovery, the developers rushed to address this matter, and so, a working fix [now exists](https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=722d94847de29310e8aa03fcbdb41fc92c521756). Red Hat has also shared a [detailed advisory](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2022-0185) in this regard.

 So now, Linux users should hurry up to download the fix. Whereas, for the cases where patching isn’t viable, users should consider disabling unprivileged user namespaces.
