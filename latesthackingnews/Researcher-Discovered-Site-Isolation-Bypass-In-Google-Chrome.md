 A researcher from Google Project Zero Team discovered a site isolation bypass vulnerability affecting the Chrome browser. Google subsequently patched the bug with Chrome 96 stable release.

 Google Chrome Site Isolation Bypass
-----------------------------------

 Reportedly, Sergei Glazunov from Project Zero found a site isolation bypass affecting Google Chrome and the underlying Chromium codebase.

 As elaborated in the researchers’ [bug report](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/project-zero/issues/detail?id=2239), a malicious website could exploit the navigation preload feature for this bypass.

 
> The browser process requests a trusted, CORB-disabled URL loader factory from the network service in order to handle navigation preload for service workers…  
>  When a preload request is initiated, the browser process passes the newly created `URLLoader` remote and `URLLoaderClient` receiver to the designated service worker…  
>  In the service worker process, the `URLLoaderClient` receiver gets bound to a `NavigationPreloadRequest` object. If the object receives a redirect notification, it doesn’t follow the redirect, but resolves the `preloadResponse` JS promise and destroys itself…  
>  However, since the `URLLoader` interface is exposed to the worker process, after achieving code execution inside the renderer, an attacker can modify `OnReceiveRedirect()` to instead call `URLLoader::FollowRedirect()`.

 Google Fixed The Vulnerability
------------------------------

 The researcher reported this vulnerability in October 2021, mentioning [Google Chrome 95.0.4638.54](https://latesthackingnews.com/2021/10/25/google-chrome-removed-ftp-for-good-deletes-code-with-chrome-95/) and Chromium 97.0.4677.0 as vulnerable products.

 Consequently, Google fixed the flaw (CVE-2021-38010) with the release of [Chrome 96.0.4664.45](https://chromereleases.googleblog.com/2021/11/stable-channel-update-for-desktop.html) in November 2021, alongside other bug fixes.

 Since the bug has received the fix, users must ensure running the latest Chrome release on their devices.

 Google introduced [site isolation](https://www.chromium.org/Home/chromium-security/site-isolation) as a security feature preventing cross-site interaction within the browser by restricted resource allocation. As the browser limits every website to run in sandbox, a malicious website can’t access sensitive data from other sites.

 This feature also served as a workaround to mitigate the infamous Meltdown and Spectre vulnerabilities [in 2018](https://latesthackingnews.com/2018/01/08/heres-meltdown-spectre-can-prevented/). Following its success, Mozilla also introduced a similar feature in its Firefox browser [in 2020](https://latesthackingnews.com/2020/10/25/firefox-brings-site-isolation-feature-for-testing-in-nightly-builds/).
