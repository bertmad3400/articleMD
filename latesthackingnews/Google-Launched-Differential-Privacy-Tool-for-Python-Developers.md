 After releasing in multiple programming languages, Google has now launched its differential privacy tool in Python to facilitate more developers. The tech giant believes that this tool will now facilitate developers in building apps with better insights and improved privacy.

 Google Differential Privacy Tool In Python
------------------------------------------

 As announced through a [recent post](https://developers.googleblog.com/2022/01/expanding-access-to-differential-privacy.html), Google, together with OpenMined – an open-source community focused on privacy technology, has now released its differential privacy tool in Python.

 Sharing the details about this move, Google explained that it decided about this step after a year of collaboration with OpenMined.

 Earlier, in 2019, Google released this tool in three programming languages, Java, Go, and C++. But, given the growing interest from developers, Google planned to expand it further.

 
> Our goal was to be transparent, and allow researchers to inspect our code. We received a tremendous amount of interest from developers who wanted to use the library in their own applications…  
>  Since then, we have been working on various projects and new ways to make differential privacy more accessible and usable.
>

 Eventually, Google has now enhanced its differential privacy framework with [Python](https://latesthackingnews.com/2016/09/04/python-favorite-programming-language-hackers/) library to facilitate more developers.

 Google described the tool as highly flexible, as users can integrate it with Spark and Beam frameworks.

 
> The library is unique as it can be used with Spark and Beam frameworks, two of the leading engines for large data processing, yielding more flexibility in its usage and implementation. We are also releasing a new differential privacy tool that allows practitioners to visualize and better tune the parameters used to produce differentially private information.

 Moreover, Google has also shared a detailed [research paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2201.11603.pdf) elaborating on their techniques to scale differential privacy on large datasets.

 Besides welcoming the developers to use this tool and experiment with differential privacy use cases, Google also asked the community to share feedback.
