 American healthcare equipment giant Hillrom has recently patched a serious zero-day vulnerability in its cardiac devices. Exploiting the bug could allow an adversary to take control of target systems.

 Zero-Day Vulnerability Spotted In Hillrom Cardiac Devices
---------------------------------------------------------

 According to the [latest advisory](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics/advisories/icsma-21-343-01) from US CISA, a serious zero-day vulnerability affected Hillrom Welch Allyn cardiac devices.

 Hill-Rom (branded as ‘Hillrom’) is a US-based [medical technology](https://latesthackingnews.com/2018/05/01/israeli-hospitals-protecting-medical-technology-from-cyber-hackers/) firm dealing with a range of healthcare equipment. The firm acquired Welch Allyn – another firm in this niche – [in 2015](https://www.syracuse.com/business/2019/05/welch-allyn-name-survives-hillrom-rebranding.html), now continuing it as a separate brand.

 Specifically, the vulnerability, which Hillrom officials spotted and reported to CISA, affected multiple Welch Allyn cardiac care devices, that include,

 * Q-Stress Cardiac Stress Testing System (versions 6.0.0-6.3.1)
* X-Scribe Cardiac Stress Testing System (versions 5.01-6.3.1)
* Diagnostic Cardiology Suite (version 2.1.0)
* Vision Express (versions 6.1.0-6.4.0)
* H-Scribe Holter Analysis System (versions 5.01-6.4.0)
* R-Scribe Resting ECG System (versions 5.01-7.0.0)
* Connex Cardio (versions 1.0.0-1.1.1)

 The tech giant identified an improper authentication flaw in the devices when configured to use Single sign-on (SSO). Describing its impact, the advisory reads,

 
> This vulnerability allows the application to accept manual entry of any active directory (AD) account provisioned in the application without supplying a password, resulting in access to the application as the supplied AD account, with all associated privileges.
> 
> 

 This zero-day flaw has achieved a CVE ID CVE-2021-43935 and a CVSS score of 8.1.

 Patches Underway
----------------

 CISA has confirmed that Hillrom has addressed the vulnerability for the products in question. However, it may take a week for the vendors to roll out the fixes with the upcoming software release.

 Until then the users [remain vulnerable](https://latesthackingnews.com/2021/02/18/shareit-android-app-vulnerabilities-remain-unfixed-for-three-months/). Hence, CISA recommends the users disable SSO in the Modality Manager Configuration settings as a workaround.

 Besides, Hillrom advises users to implement adequate network and physical security controls to the devices and to employ server access authentication.
