 The popular communication platform Zoom continues improving its features as it increases its userbase. Recently, Zoom has rolled out the auto-update feature for Windows and Mac users, while the mobile phone apps already receive updates via the respective app stores. Linux, however, still awaits this feature.

 Zoom Auto-Update Feature Released
---------------------------------

 Announcing the change via a recent [blog post](https://blog.zoom.us/get-automatic-updates-in-the-zoom-client/), Jeromie Clark, Technical Product Manager at zoom, has shared details about the new auto-update feature.

 As revealed, Zoom users can now have their desktop app clients updated automatically whenever the firm releases updates.

 Since last year, Zoom skyrocketed its userbase as customers increasingly adopted it as a key communication feature in the post-[COVID-19](https://latesthackingnews.com/?s=covid) scenario. Users from the corporate sector, [educational institutions](https://latesthackingnews.com/2021/02/26/educational-institutions-websites-found-vulnerable-to-multiple-threats/), governments, and other formal setups used this app for video conferencing.

 That’s where Zoom attracted negative attention too, as hackers could exploit the underlying unpatched [vulnerabilities in the software](https://latesthackingnews.com/tag/zoom-vulnerability/).

 However, Zoom kept addressing the issues, improving privacy and ensuring better security to users’ communications.

 Their most recent step in this regard has been the launch of [end-to-end encryption](https://latesthackingnews.com/2020/10/19/zoom-rolls-out-end-to-end-encryption-as-technical-preview/) followed by [two-factor authentication](https://latesthackingnews.com/2020/09/14/zoom-launch-two-factor-authentication-for-all-accounts/).

 However, the problem that could still risk users was a manual update for the Zoom clients. This would often leave users’ clients vulnerable despite the rollout of bug fixes from the vendors.

 Hence, the company has now rolled out an automatic update feature for the users to receive the patches timely. As stated in the post,

 
> Automatic updates help our users easily receive important security fixes and helpful features, improving their overall experience with the Zoom platform.
> 
> 

 To activate this feature, users need to follow this path to find the desired option: **Settings > General > Automatically keep my Zoom up to date**. Check this option alongside choosing the desired frequency of app updates you wish to receive.

 Once enabled, users shall automatically receive updates when available. They can then choose to defer updates. However, the app shall automatically update upon the subsequent restart. That’s how it will save the users from the burden of managing app updates.
