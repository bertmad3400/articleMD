 As Log4j vulnerability continues to haunt the internet world, more bug scanners have surfaced online to help prevent real-time exploits. Recently, the US CISA and CrowdStrike have also separately released Log4j vulnerability scanners for free.

 US CISA, CrowdStrike Log4j Scanners
-----------------------------------

 The US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) has recently released a free Log4j scanning tool. As announced from its official Twitter account, US CISA intends to help organizations proactively detect and address Log4j vulnerabilities with this open-source scanner.

 
>  We published an open-sourced log4j-scanner derived from scanners created by other members of the open-source community. This tool is intended to help organizations identify potentially vulnerable web services affected by the log4j vulnerabilities: <https://t.co/af8uszW8K4>

  Regarding the scanning tool available on [GitHub](https://github.com/cisagov/log4j-scanner), CISA explained,

 
> The information and code in this repository is provided “as is” and was assembled with the help of the open-source community and updated by CISA through collaboration with the broader cybersecurity community.

 Likewise, CrowdStrike has also released a [Log4j](https://latesthackingnews.com/?s=log4j) vulnerability scanner to help the cybersecurity community. They have also put up their tool as open-source on GitHub.

 Identifying this tool as [CAST](https://github.com/CrowdStrike/CAST)  (CrowdStrike Archive Scan Tool), the firm explained that this tool could scan different directories for vulnerable Log4j versions.

 Elaborating on this tool in a [blog post](https://www.crowdstrike.com/blog/free-targeted-log4j-search-tool/), CrowdStrike stated,

 
> The free CrowdStrike tool (dubbed the CrowdStrike Archive Scan Tool, or “CAST”) performs a targeted search by scanning a given set of directories for JAR, WAR, ZIP and EAR files, and then it performs a deeper scan on those file types matching against a known set of checksums for Log4j libraries…  
>  CAST searches for approximately 6,500 SHA256 checksums unique to the known vulnerable releases. It will walk the files or directories scanning inside of ZIP-format archives to find every instance of these.
> 
> 

 The firm believes that this tool will facilitate organizations to scan their systems as it supports multi-platform compatibility. Specifically, CAST works on Windows, macOS, and Linux alike.

 Before these scanners, Google also [added Log4j detection functionality in its OSS-Fuzz](https://latesthackingnews.com/2021/12/20/googles-oss-fuzz-tool-now-detects-log4shell-via-jazzer/) tool.

 Hence, users now have multiple ways to detect vulnerable Log4j instances affecting their systems. Also, users must ensure updating to [Log4j version 2.17.0](https://latesthackingnews.com/2021/12/20/apache-releases-third-major-log4j-update-to-fix-a-dos-flaw/) at the earliest to receive the patch against the devastating [Log4Shell](https://latesthackingnews.com/2021/12/12/critical-log4shell-zero-day-vulnerability-wreaks-havoc-online/) vulnerability.
