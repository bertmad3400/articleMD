Microsoft announced plans today to split the pricing model for the commercial version of its antivirus product, known as Microsoft Defender for Endpoint, introducing a cheaper plan and making its product more easily and broadly available to companies that typically couldn’t afford it.


Prior to today’s announcement, Microsoft Defender for Endpoint was only available for companies that signed up for a Microsoft 365 E5 license, the most expensive tier in [Microsoft’s enterprise licensing scheme](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/compare-microsoft-365-enterprise-plans?SilentAuth=1).


With a price of $57/user/month, E5 licenses are out of reach for many companies with smaller IT budgets, which will often use cheaper third-party antivirus solutions instead.


Today, [Microsoft said](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-defender-for-endpoint/introducing-microsoft-defender-for-endpoint-plan-1/ba-p/2636641) it plans to split Defender for Endpoint into two new licensing options named Plan 1 and Plan 2.


The difference between the two is that Plan 1 will include only a subset of the Defender for Endpoint features, namely those focused on endpoint protection capabilities.


The rest of the Defender for Endpoint features will be available as part of Plan 2, where most of Microsoft’s current customers will be automatically moved later this year.

But the best news out of today’s announcements is that Microsoft is also lowering minimum requirements.


While Defender for Endpoint was previously only available for E5 license holders, Plan 1 will be made [available for E3 customers](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/security/defender-endpoint/mde-p1-setup-configuration?view=o365-worldwide#review-the-requirements), while Plan 2 remains its top offering [for E5 clients only](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/security/defender-endpoint/minimum-requirements?view=o365-worldwide).


As several security experts have pointed out today on social media, the move is a boon for small and medium-sized businesses, which have wanted to sign up for Defender’s broad detection and monitoring capabilities but could not afford the extremely expensive licenses. Prior 





Prior to today’s announcement, many security experts have called on Microsoft to move Defender into its E3 in order to make it more accessible for companies with lower budgets, which often can’t afford dedicated security teams and are victims of most of today’s cyberattacks.





 



Microsoft Defender for Endpoint Plan 1 is currently free while in a public preview. Companies can test it for free by [signing up for the preview period](https://aka.ms/MDEP1trial).


Microsoft expects Plan 1 to become generally available later this year when it plans to move all Microsoft Defender for Endpoint customers to Plan 2.


Once generally available, Plan 1 will be offered in two ways:


1. As a standalone SKU licensed per user. Eligible licensed users will be able to use Microsoft Defender for Endpoint Plan 1 on up to five concurrent devices.
2. Included as part of Microsoft 365 E3/A3 with the same per user model and device entitlements as stated above.


E3 licenses are currently priced at $32/user/month.


Despite some [price hikes for Office subscriptions](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/08/19/microsoft-will-raise-office-365-business-subscription-prices-in-2022.html) that are expected in 2022, Microsoft told CNBC last week that E3 and E5 licenses will remain at the same price points.


Microsoft Defender for Endpoint was previously known as Defender Advanced Threat Protection and is currently available for Windows, macOS, Android, and iOS devices. The commercial version of Defender has been almost universally reviewed and acknowledged as one of the best security solutions for Windows systems. The product is has a wide install base in many of the world’s largest companies and many western government agencies.
