The US government has sanctioned today four companies that develop and sell spyware and other hacking tools, the US Department of Commerce announced today.


The four companies include Israel’s **NSO Group** and **Candiru**, Russian security firm **Positive Technologies**, and Singapore-based **Computer Security Initiative Consultancy**.


US officials said the four companies engaged in “activities that are contrary to the national security or foreign policy interests of the United States.”


Commerce officials said NSO Group and Candiru “developed and supplied spyware to foreign governments that used these tools to maliciously target government officials, journalists, businesspeople, activists, academics, and embassy workers.”


The US said these tools were abused by foreign governments to conduct trans-national repression of dissidents, journalists, and activists outside of those governments’ sovereign borders.


Similarly, Positive Technologies and CSIC were accused of creating and selling “cyber tools” that were later used to hack individuals and organizations worldwide.

The four companies, including their aliases (detailed in the table above), were added to a list of entities engaging in malicious cyber activities that is currently maintained by the Commerce Department’s Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS).


US companies and agencies must obtain a special license from BIS before buying, exporting, or transferring any cyber tools developed by the four companies. Commerce officials said that all applicants should expect a “presumption of denial” when applying for this license.


“Today’s action is a part of the Biden-Harris Administration’s efforts to put human rights at the center of US foreign policy, including by working to stem the proliferation of digital tools used for repression,” the Department of Commerce said in a [press release](https://www.commerce.gov/news/press-releases/2021/11/commerce-adds-nso-group-and-other-foreign-companies-entity-list) today, announcing its decision.


The Department of Commerce did not reveal the finer points and evidence it used to sanction the four companies, but for three of the four sanctioned companies, there’s been some public reporting of how their hacking tools have been abused over the past few years:


* **NSO Group** developed the Pegasus hacking platform, which the company rents to foreign governments. Pegasus abuses have been very [well documented](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NSO_Group) across the years.
* **Candiru** was [recently exposed](https://therecord.media/windows-spyware-and-zero-days-linked-to-prodigious-israeli-hack-for-hire-company/) in reports by Microsoft and Citizen Lab as the creators of the DevilsEye Windows spyware. The company’s hack-for-hire offerings have been [known](https://www.forbes.com/sites/thomasbrewster/2019/10/03/meet-candiru-the-super-stealth-cyber-mercenaries-hacking-apple-and-microsoft-pcs-for-profit/) [for years](https://www.haaretz.com/middle-east-news/.premium-top-secret-israeli-cyberattack-firm-revealed-1.6805950), and the company is also believed to have also developed and sold zero-day exploits for Chrome, Internet Explorer, and Windows.
* **Positive Technologies** has been accused of having developed and sold exploits t[o Russian intelligence agencies](https://www.technologyreview.com/2021/04/15/1022895/us-sanctions-russia-positive-hacking/). The company was already under US Treasury sanctions [since April this year](https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy0127).


Fewer details are available about Singapore-based CSIC, but the company is known for running an exploit acquisition program named [Pwn0rama](https://www.coseinc.com/pwn0rama/#pwn0rama_about). There is currently no public reporting linking exploits bought via this program to known attacks, beyond the Commerce Department press release today.


The Record has sent requests for comment on today’s sanctions to Positive Technologies, CSIC, and NSO Group. No contact details were available for Candiru. The email to NSO Group bounced after the company announced earlier this year that they would stop responding to press inquiries.
