China is set to increase its spending on network security by 110 percent in the first half of the year to $1.1 billion when compared with 2020 — that’s a year-on-year increase of 38 percent compared with 2019, according to a [new report](https://www.idc.com/getdoc.jsp?containerId=prCHE48302321) by the marketing intelligence firm, IDC.


The appetite for network security products and services is partly a result of the [Cybersecurity Law](https://www.newamerica.org/cybersecurity-initiative/digichina/blog/translation-cybersecurity-law-peoples-republic-china/) China promulgated in 2017 that, among other things, has required network operators to store much of their data in-country. The result has been a run on everything from products and services for traditional network testing and monitoring to creating a new market for cloud providers and hosting services, the report said.


Security consultancy spending, for example, rose an eye-popping 172 percent year-on-year, the report said. (COVID likely put a crimp in the market last year, the report said, because lots of consulting services were put on hold during various lock-downs. Now, it said, they have returned with a vengeance.)


Also adding to the breakneck growth: an increase in so-called “smart city” spending and other infrastructure-related projects that have required a generation of training people to understand network systems.


The report said China’s server market also saw a boom, increasingly 85.1% year-on-year, to $2.19 billion. GPU servers made up 91.9 percent of the purchases, the report said, and Inspur, Ningchang, and Huawei accounted for about 70 percent of the market.
