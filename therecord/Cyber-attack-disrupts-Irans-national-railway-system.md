Boards inside some train stations listed the phone number for the office of Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei and asked travelers to call for additional details.


Spokespersons for the Islamic Republic of Iran Railways (IRIR) and the Ministry of Roads and Urban Development initially denied rumors of a cyberattack in statements offered to local media in the afternoon [[1](https://www.farsnews.ir/news/14000418000569/%D8%A7%D8%AE%D9%84%D8%A7%D9%84-%D8%AF%D8%B1-%D8%B3%DB%8C%D8%B3%D8%AA%D9%85-%D8%A8%D8%A7%D8%B2%D8%B1%DA%AF%D8%A7%D9%86%DB%8C-%D8%B1%D8%A7%D9%87-%D8%A2%D9%87%D9%86-%D8%B3%DB%8C%D8%B1-%D8%B9%D8%A7%D8%AF%DB%8C-%D9%82%D8%B7%D8%A7%D8%B1%D9%87%D8%A7-%D8%B7%D8%A8%D9%82-%D8%A8%D8%B1%D9%86%D8%A7%D9%85%D9%87), [2](https://www.iribnews.ir/fa/news/3160171/%D8%A7%D8%B7%D9%84%D8%A7%D8%B9%DB%8C%D9%87-%D8%B1%D8%A7%D9%87-%D8%A2%D9%87%D9%86-%D9%82%D8%B7%D8%A7%D8%B1%E2%80%8C%D9%87%D8%A7-%D8%B7%D8%A8%D9%82-%D8%A8%D8%B1%D9%86%D8%A7%D9%85%D9%87-%D8%A7%D8%B9%D8%B2%D8%A7%D9%85-%D9%85%DB%8C%E2%80%8C%D8%B4%D9%88%D9%86%D8%AF), [3](https://www.tasnimnews.com/fa/news/1400/04/18/2535381/%D8%B1%D8%A7%D9%87-%D8%A2%D9%87%D9%86-%D8%AF%D8%B1-%D8%AD%D8%A7%D9%84-%D8%AD%D8%A7%D8%B6%D8%B1-%D8%A7%D8%AE%D8%AA%D9%84%D8%A7%D9%84%DB%8C-%D8%AF%D8%B1-%D8%AD%D8%B1%DA%A9%D8%AA-%D9%82%D8%B7%D8%A7%D8%B1%D9%87%D8%A7-%D9%86%D8%AF%D8%A7%D8%B1%DB%8C%D9%85)], despite the obvious defacements of some train announcements boards.


Officials described the incident as a technical issue and said passenger and freight trains were running normally by 7 PM local time, although with some delays, with staff managing schedules by hand.


However, Iranian officials [confirmed the attack](https://www.presstv.ir/Detail/2021/07/10/661962/Iran-cyber-attack-transportation-ministry) on Saturday, after screenshots leaked online of defaced computers belonging to the Ministry of Roads and Urban Development.
