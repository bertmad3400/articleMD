The White House and U.S tech giants on Wednesday made a host of commitments intended to boost the country’s cybersecurity.


“I’ve invited you all here today because you have the power, the capacity, and the responsibility, I believe, to raise the bar on cybersecurity,” President Joe Biden said at the beginning of the summit that was attended by chief executives from Google, Amazon, Apple, Microsoft, IBM and leaders from a number of other sectors.


Here’s a rundown of the [pledges](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/08/25/fact-sheet-biden-administration-and-private-sector-leaders-announce-ambitious-initiatives-to-bolster-the-nations-cybersecurity/) that were made:
