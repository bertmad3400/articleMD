Facebook is dropping its Face Recognition tagging feature and will delete templates on more than one billion people, the service [announced](https://about.fb.com/news/2021/11/update-on-use-of-face-recognition/) in a blog post Tuesday. The social media network “will delete more than a billion people’s individual facial recognition templates,” wrote Jerome Pesenti—VP of Artificial Intelligence at Meta.


(Meta is a rebrand of Facebook’s parent company announced last month amidst reporting on internal Facebook documents that show the company was aware of harmful outcomes of its platform, including [amplification](https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/facebook-knew-radicalized-users-rcna3581) of radicalizing misinformation and negative mental health outcomes for [teen users.](https://www.wsj.com/articles/facebook-knows-instagram-is-toxic-for-teen-girls-company-documents-show-11631620739) Company founder Mark Zuckerberg announced the name change at the same time as plans to double down on building the Metaverse, an immersive virtual experience named after the term for such worlds coined in [a dystopian Neal Stephenson science fiction novel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snow_Crash#Metaverse).)


Facebook has long used its access to a vast cache of visual data to power [features](https://www.theverge.com/2017/12/19/16794660/facebook-facial-recognition-tagging-photos) that can automatically recognize people in photos and videos. It’s also faced legal challenges over the privacy implications of those features—including [a class action suit](https://www.chicagotribune.com/business/ct-prem-biz-facebook-privacy-settlement-delay-appeal-20210405-fydkqfwkrfew7jc6koe2rbmndy-story.html) under Illinois’ biometric privacy law. 


The facial recognition change was met by surprise and delight by privacy advocates and researchers.





Other companies have previously paused some facial recognition efforts amidst public backlash. In May, [Amazon announced](https://www.reuters.com/technology/exclusive-amazon-extends-moratorium-police-use-facial-recognition-software-2021-05-18/) it would indefinitely extend a ban on police use of its facial recognition systems. Amazon first announced the prohibition during the racial justice protests during the summer of 2020 and after [pitching its facial recognition products](https://www.thedailybeast.com/amazon-pushes-ice-to-buy-its-face-recognition-surveillance-tech) to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement as the Trump administration cracked down on immigration.


Research shows facial recognition technology is less accurate at identifying people with darker skins—and such tools are already connected to [reports](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/29/technology/facial-recognition-misidentify-jail.html) of Black people being arrested and imprisoned due to misidentification.


Pesenti wrote the decision to drop Face Recognition from Facebook was driven by larger societal concerns and a lack of clear regulatory guidance. While dropping this major implementation of facial recognition technology, the company will continue to explore its use in more limited use cases—including to unlock accounts, for example, he wrote.


The decision to drop the Face Recognition feature is part of “a company-wide move away from this kind of broad identification, and toward narrower forms of personal authentication,” according to the blog post.
