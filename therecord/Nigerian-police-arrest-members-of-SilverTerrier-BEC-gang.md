Interpol said today that Nigerian authorities have detained 11 internet scammers, including members of the SilverTerrier cybercrime group.


Authorities said the suspects engaged in [Business Email Compromise (BEC)](https://www.fbi.gov/scams-and-safety/common-scams-and-crimes/business-email-compromise), a type of internet crime where hackers use phishing emails or email account hacks to trick companies or government entities into making payments to the wrong bank accounts.


The arrests took place last year, between December 13 and December 22, as part of Operation Falcon II.


Interpol said that following a forensic analysis of the data extracted from phones and computers seized during house searches, they said the 11 suspects were linked to attacks on more than 50,000 targets.


“One of the arrested suspects was in possession of more than 800,000 potential victim domain credentials on his laptop,” Interpol officials said today.


Another suspect had breached accounts and was monitoring conversations inside 16 companies and their customers and was seen diverting funds to accounts linked to [SilverTerrier](https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/silverterrier-covid-19-themed-business-email-compromise/), a well-known cybercrime group engaged in BEC scams.


In addition, officials said that a third suspect was also linked to BEC attacks across a wide range of West African countries, including Gambia, Ghana, and Nigeria, something that is quite rare, as BEC gangs typically targeted western companies.


### Follow-up to Operation Falcon (2020)


[Operation Falcon II](https://www.interpol.int/en/News-and-Events/News/2022/Nigerian-cybercrime-fraud-11-suspects-arrested-syndicate-busted) is a follow-up for [Operation Falcon](https://www.interpol.int/en/News-and-Events/News/2020/Three-arrested-as-INTERPOL-Group-IB-and-the-Nigeria-Police-Force-disrupt-prolific-cybercrime-group), which took place in November 2020 and resulted in the arrest of three suspects who were members of the TMT cybercrime gang.


In addition, Interpol also worked with the same Nigerian authorities to arrest another [18 suspects in March 2021](https://therecord.media/suspected-bec-gang-arrested-in-nigeria-amid-internet-fraud-crackdown-efforts/), who were also believed to have participated in a wide range of BEC attacks.


According to the [FBI’s 2020 cybercrime report](https://therecord.media/fbi-cybercrime-losses-exceeded-4-2-billion-in-2020/), BEC scam attacks ranked as the top source of financial losses in internet-related crime for the third year in a row, with nearly $1.9 billion lost in 2020 alone.


According to a report published by cyber-security firm Agari in October 2020, around [50% of all BEC scam groups](https://agari.com/insights/whitepapers/threat-intelligence-brief-geography-bec/) are believed to reside in Nigeria.


The Interpol arrests last year are part of a recent crackdown from Nigerian authorities against the local BEC scene, which also included several other arrests, such as:


* The arrest of 167 suspects in Nigeria in September 2019 as part of [Operation reWired](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/281-arrested-worldwide-coordinated-international-enforcement-operation-targeting-hundreds).
* The arrest of [two brothers](https://www.efccnigeria.org/efcc/news/5144-efcc-arrests-two-brothers-who-allegedly-use-commission-s-name-to-extort-yahoo-boys) in November 2019.
* The arrest in June 2020 of a [famous social media influencer named Hushpuppi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hushpuppi) who made his fortune through BEC scams.
* The arrest of [six other fraudsters](https://www.efccnigeria.org/efcc/news/5782-fbi-commends-efcc-on-indictment-of-six-nigerians-for-cyber-crime) in the same month.

* The arrest of [ten suspects](https://guardian.ng/news/efcc-arrests-10-suspected-internet-fraudsters-in-port-harcourt/) in early March 2021.
