A Canadian man who plead guilty to laundering tens of millions of dollars stolen in bank fraud schemes, including a massive cyberheist carried out by North Korean cybercriminals, was sentenced to more than 11 years in prison, the US Department of Justice [announced](https://www.justice.gov/usao-cdca/pr/international-money-launderer-sentenced-over-11-years-federal-prison-laundering) on Wednesday.


Ghaleb Alaumary, a 36-year-old American dual citizen living in Mississauga, Ontario, was also ordered to pay more than $30 million in restitution to victims.


Federal prosecutors in California and Georgia [unsealed charges](https://www.justice.gov/usao-cdca/pr/3-north-korean-military-hackers-indicted-wide-ranging-scheme-commit-cyberattacks-and) against Alaumary in February, at the same time that charges were announced against three North Korean hackers who were accused of stealing more than $1.3 billion from financial institutions and conducting a series of destructive cyberattacks. According to court documents, Alaumary conspired with a Nigerian national named Ramon Olorunwa Abbas to launder funds that North Korean cybercriminals pilfered from a Maltese bank in February 2019.


Alaumary was considered a “prolific” money launderer in the hacking community, according to the DOJ, and helped hackers engaged in ATM cash-out schemes, cyber-enabled bank heists, business email compromise (BEC) schemes, and other online fraud schemes. Victims included BankIslami in Pakistan, which experienced an ATM cash-out theft in 2018, a professional soccer club in the United Kingdom, a bank headquartered in India, as well as various unnamed companies in the US and U.K.
