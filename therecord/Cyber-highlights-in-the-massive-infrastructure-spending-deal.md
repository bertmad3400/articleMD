The bipartisan physical infrastructure deal unveiled on Sunday contains several cybersecurity provisions, including some meant to bolster state and local digital efforts.


Here are some highlights from the finished 2,702-page document:


* **$21 million for the Office of the National Cyber Director.** House and Senate lawmakers have been working to support newly-installed National Cyber Director Chris Inglis, [who was sworn in last month](https://therecord.media/inglis-sworn-in-as-first-national-cyber-czar/) but lacks funding for hiring and other needs.
* **Cyber Response and Recovery Fund.** The package would appropriate $20 million annually through 2028 for the fund, a major priority for the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, which would use the account to pay for help from other agencies when responding to digital incidents.
* **$1 billion cyber grant fund.** State and local governments would be able to utilize the fund, which will be administered by FEMA with assistance from CISA, over the next four years to help modernize and upgrade their IT infrastructure.


Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) and the dealâ€™s negotiators have predicted the Senate could wrap up the bipartisan bill by the end of the week. The House is on recess until September.
