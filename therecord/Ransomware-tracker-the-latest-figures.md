Colonial Pipeline, JBS Foods, Kaseya — we’re only halfway through 2021, but it can already be dubbed the year of ransomware. The problem isn’t impacting all organizations to the same degree, however. According to data collected by Recorded Future, attacks against the most vulnerable organizations — schools, healthcare facilities, state and local governments — have plateaued or even decreased in recent months.


Ransomware expert Allan Liska explains that threat actors are focusing their efforts on organizations that can stomach multimillion-dollar ransom demands. “They’re not looking at state and local governments as much, because they’re not going to get those returns there,” he said. You can catch up on the latest data using this ransomware tracker, which is based off data collected from government agencies, news reports, hacking forums, and other sources. We’ll keep updating it throughout the year.
