A threat actor has abused a vulnerability in the Wormhole cryptocurrency platform to steal an estimated $322 million worth of Ether currency.


The attack took place earlier today and impacted [Wormhole Portal](https://portalbridge.com/#/), a web-based application—also known as a blockchain “bridge”—that allows users to convert one form of cryptocurrency into another.


Bridge portals use “smart contracts” on the Ethereum blockchain to convert an input cryptocurrency into a temporary internal token, which they later convert into the user’s desired output cryptocurrency.


The attacker is believed to have exploited this process to trick the Wormhole project into releasing [Ether (ETH)](https://etherscan.io/address/0x629e7da20197a5429d30da36e77d06cdf796b71a) and [Solana (SOL)](https://solscan.io/account/CxegPrfn2ge5dNiQberUrQJkHCcimeR4VXkeawcFBBka) coins far beyond the input they initially provided.


According to reports, the attacker stole crypto-assets worth $322.8 million at the time of the attack, and which have depreciated to $294 million due to price fluctuations following news of the hack.


While a Wormhole spokesperson has not returned a request for comment on today’s incident, the company has confirmed the attack earlier today on Twitter and has put its site into [maintenance mode](https://web.archive.org/web/20220202224805/https://portalbridge.com/) while it investigates the incident.





Tal Be’ery, CTO at cryptocurrency wallet app [ZenGo](https://zengo.com/) and the one who alerted The Record about the Wormhole attack, said the hack is part of a recent “trend of exploiting [blockchain] bridges.”


Just a week earlier, a similar attack took place against another blockchain bridge when a hacker stole [$80 million from Qubit Finance](https://therecord.media/qubit-finance-platform-hacked-for-80-million-worth-of-cryptocurrency/).


Once Wormhole formally confirms the amount of stolen funds, the incident will likely become the largest hack of a cryptocurrency platform so far this year, and the [second-largest hack](https://defiyield.app/rekt-database) of a decentralized finance (DeFi) platform of all time, according to data compiled by the DeFiYield project.


### Wormhole offers hacker $10 million as “bug bounty”


Be’ery pointed out that just like in the Qubit hack, Wormhole is now [appealing](https://www.notifi.xyz/messages/1497) to the hacker and asking them to return the stolen funds in exchange for a $10 million reward and a “whitehat contract” that will most likely mean the platform won’t file any criminal complaint against the attacker.


However, [as a former Uber executive found out](https://www.zdnet.com/article/former-uber-cso-charged-for-2016-hack-cover-up/), such contracts exonerating hackers are not legal in certain jurisdictions and authorities might still go after the attacker anyway.
