The European Union will fund a bug bounty program for five open source projects that are heavily used by public services across the EU.


The five programs include [LibreOffice](https://www.libreoffice.org/), a document editing app and a free alternative to Microsoft Office; [Mastodon](https://github.com/mastodon/mastodon), a web-based utility for hosting your private social network; [Odoo](https://www.odoo.com/), an enterprise resource planning (ERP) application; [Cryptopad](https://cryptpad.fr/), an app exchanging encrypted messages; and [LEOS](https://github.com/l-e-x/leos), a software designed to help with drafting legislation.


The bug bounty program will run throughout the year on the Intigriti bug bounty platform, and the EU will provide a rewards pool of up to €200,000 ($225,000).


Bug hunters will be eligible to earn as much as €5,000 ($5,600) for “exceptional vulnerabilities,” and they can also earn a 20% bonus if they provide a fix within their reports.


The new program was [announced](https://ec.europa.eu/info/news/european-commissions-open-source-programme-office-starts-bug-bounties-2022-jan-19_en) last week and is sponsored by the European Commission Open Source Programme Office (EC OSPO).


Founded in 2020, EC OSPO is the spiritual successor to the EU-FOSSA (EU-Free and Open Source Software Auditing) project, through which the EU also previously funded two other bug bounty program initiatives for open-source software in [2017](https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/open-source-observatory-osor/news/hackerone-vlc) and [2018](https://juliareda.eu/2018/12/eu-fossa-bug-bounties/), respectively.


In the first edition, the EU funded bug reports for VLC Player, a popular free video player, while in the second edition, the EU-FOSSA sponsored bug reports for 14 projects, such as 7-zip, Apache Kafka, Apache Tomcat, Digital Signature Services (DSS), Drupal, Filezilla, FLUX TL, the GNU C Library (glibc), KeePass, midPoint, Notepad++, PuTTY, the Symfony PHP framework, VLC Media Player, and WSO2.


The same program also [funded security audits](https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/eu-fossa-2/solution/eu-fossa-pilot/news/ec-audit-apache-http-serve) for the Apache HTTPD web server and the Keepass password manager.
