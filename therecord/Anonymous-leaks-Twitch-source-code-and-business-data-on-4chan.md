Individuals claiming to be part of the Anonymous hacker collective have leaked the source code and business data of video streaming platform Twitch via a torrent file posted on the 4chan discussion board earlier today.


Anonymous said they leaked the data as a response to the recent “[hate raids](https://www.techmeme.com/210812/p14#a210812p14)” —coordinated bot attacks posting hateful and abusive content in Twitch chats— that have plagued the platform’s top streamers over the summer.


“Their community is […] a disgusting toxic cesspool, so to foster more disruption and competition in the online video streaming space, we have completely pwned them, and in part one, are releasing the source code from almost 6,000 internal Git repositories,” the leakers said earlier today.


*The Record* has downloaded parts of the 128 GB torrent file shared by the leakers in order to confirm its authenticity.

The content of the leak is in tune with what the hacktivists claimed to have shared earlier today, quoted below:


* Entirety of Twitch.tv, with commit history going back to its early beginnings
* Mobile, desktop and video game console Twitch clients
* Various proprietary SDKs and internal AWS services used by Twitch
* Every other property that Twitch owns including IGDB and CurseForge
* An unreleased Steam competitor from Amazon Game Studios
* Twitch SOC internal red teaming tools (lol)
* AND: Creator payout reports from 2019 until now. Find out how much your favorite streamer is really making!


Among the treasure trove of data, the most sensitive folders are the ones holding information about Twitch’s user identity and authentication mechanisms, admin management tools, and data from Twitch’s internal security team, including white-boarded threat models describing various parts of Twitch’s backend infrastructure [*see redacted image below*].

While at the time of writing, *The Record* was unable to find personal details for any Twitch users, the leak also contained payout schemes for the platform’s top streamers.


The data, which we will not be linking or sharing in any way, is exposing the monthly revenues for some of the platform’s biggest earners, some of which reach six-figure sums; data that could be a boon for extortionists and criminal groups.


A Twitch spokesperson did not immediately return a request for comment regarding today’s leak.


The leak also comes a month after thousands of Twitch streams organized the [#ADayOffTwitch walkout](https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/31/22650578/twitch-streamers-walkout-protest-hate-raids?scrolla=5eb6d68b7fedc32c19ef33b4) on September 1, refusing to stream in response to the ever-increasing hate raids.


In August, Twitch promised to address the hate raids in a [message posted on Twitter](https://twitter.com/Twitch/status/1428813772391522307), asking for patience as the spam attacks did not have “a simple fix.”


*Developing story. More updates will likely follow through the day.*
