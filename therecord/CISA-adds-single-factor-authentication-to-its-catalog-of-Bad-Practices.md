Earlier this year, [in June](https://www.cisa.gov/blog/2021/06/24/bad-practices), the US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) launched a new project called “**Bad Practices**” that consisted of a catalog of non-recommended cybersecurity practices, techniques, and configurations.


The initial list only included two entries, but in an [update today](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ncas/current-activity/2021/08/30/cisa-adds-single-factor-authentication-list-bad-practices), CISA officials added a new “bad practice” to their list—namely, the use of single-factor authentication for remote or administrative access systems.


“Single-factor authentication is a common low-security method of authentication,” the agency said in a press release today. “It only requires matching one factor—such as a password—to a username to gain access to a system.”


Instead, CISA recommended that organizations check its guide for implementing strong authentication [[PDF](https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/publications/CISA_CEG_Implementing_Strong_Authentication_508_1.pdf)], where multi-factor authentication is the recommended method of securing not only internet-connected accounts but also accounts of any kind.


### CISA Bad Practices catalog


Currently, the CISA Bad Practices catalog includes the following entries:


1. **Use of unsupported (or end-of-life) software.**
2. **Use of known/fixed/default passwords and credentials.**
3. **Use of single-factor authentication for remote or administrative access to systems.**


Other bad practices CISA officials are currently considering adding to their catalog include the likes of:


* Using weak cryptographic functions or key sizes.
* Flat network topologies.
* Mingling of IT and OT networks.
* Everyone’s an administrator (lack of least privilege).
* Utilization of previously compromised systems without sanitization.
* Transmission of sensitive, unencrypted/unauthenticated traffic over uncontrolled networks.
* Poor physical controls.
