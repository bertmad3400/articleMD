Ukrainian law enforcement announced the arrest of a suspect on accusations of running a giant malware botnet of more than 100,000 infected systems.


Authorities said the suspect used their botnet to launch DDoS attacks, send spam, brute-force user account passwords, scan networks for vulnerabilities, and exploit them.


The arrest was [announced](https://ssu.gov.ua/novyny/sbu-blokuvala-diialnist-armii-botiv-yaka-poshyriuvala-virusni-prohramy-i-zdiisniuvala-ddos-ta-spamataky) today by the Security Service of Ukraine (SSU):


* The suspect’s name was not released.
* The arrest took place in the Ivano-Frankivsk region, in the Kolomyia district.
* SSU officers searched the suspect’s house and seized their computer equipment.
* SSU said the suspect had advertised their services via Telegram and closed-access forums.
* The suspect took payment via [WebMoney](https://www.wmtransfer.com/), a Russian money transfer platform banned in Ukraine.


News of the arrest comes after Russian security firm Rostelecom-Solar helped [sinkhole the Meris DDoS botnet](https://therecord.media/russian-security-firm-sinkholes-part-of-the-dangerous-meris-ddos-botnet/) and after US authorities charged a Turkish national in connection to [the WireX botnet](https://therecord.media/turkish-national-charged-for-ddos-attacks-with-the-wirex-botnet/).


It is unclear to which malware botnet the suspect arrested in Ukraine is connected. An SSU spokesperson did not return a request for comment.
