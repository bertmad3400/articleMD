US software company SolarWinds has released security updates on Saturday to patch a vulnerability in its Serv-U file transferring technology that is being actively exploited in the wild.


The attacks and the vulnerability were discovered by Microsoft, SolarWinds said in a security advisory published over the weekend.


Tracked as **CVE-2021-35211**, the vulnerability is a remote code execution (RCE) bug that can be exploited via the SSH protocol to run malicious code with elevated privileges on SolarWinds applications.


The Texas-based company said the vulnerable Serv-U technology was only included with the **Serv-U Managed File Transfer**and**Serv-U Secure FTP**products and that no other SolarWinds application is affected.


* Neither SolarWinds nor Microsoft said when the attacks abusing CVE-2021-53211 started nor who was behind them.
* A Serv-U hotfix was released on Friday, July 9, 2021 — v15.2.3 HF2.
* SolarWinds shared some indicators of compromise (IOCs) related to the attacks in its [security advisory](https://www.solarwinds.com/trust-center/security-advisories/cve-2021-35211). We will not be reproducing them here in case SolarWinds updates the IOCs.
* All Serv-U versions prior to v15.2.3 HF2, released on Friday, are vulnerable to attacks.
* Disabling SSH access on the two affected products prevents exploitation.
* According to a [Censys search query](https://search.censys.io/search?resource=hosts&q=services.banner%3A+%22SSH-2.0-Serv-U*%22+AND+services.service_name%3A+%22SSH%22), there are more than 8,200 SolarWinds Serv-U systems exposing their SSH port online.
