* 33 suspects were arrested in the US for BEC and romance scam-related crimes.
* Suspects are believed to be members of Black Axe, a Nigerian confraternity and crime syndicate.
* The 33 suspects were accused of stealing more than $17 million from at least 100 victims.


**The FBI has arrested 33 individuals across Texas for a series of cybercrime-related activities, including BEC and romance scams.**


The arrests, which took place last week, targeted individuals part of Black Axe, a transnational organized crime syndicate originating from Nigeria and operating across the globe.


Eleven suspects were charged in the Northern District of Texas and another 23 in the Eastern District, with one suspect charged in both districts.


### Suspects stole more than $17 million


US officials said the group had been active since at least January 2017 and engaged in a wide range of fraudulent schemes, such as business email compromise (BEC), investor scams, and unemployment insurance fraud.


The suspects also engaged in online romance scams, operating on dating sites such as Match.com, ChistianMingle, JSwipe, and Plenty of Fish.


In total, authorities said the group stole and laundered more than $17 million, funds they acquired from at least 100 victims, according to [court documents](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/21069844-black-axe-indictment) obtained by *The Record*.


### Group tied to Black Axe gang


Sources familiar with the group’s activities said the suspects were members of [Black Axe](https://www.faz.net/aktuell/gesellschaft/kriminalitaet/investigation-on-the-neo-black-movement-a-k-a-black-axe-16898417.html), a known criminal syndicate tied to the **Neo Black Movement**, a college fraternity founded in the 1970s in Nigeria that slowly evolved into a [secret society, cult, and confraternity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confraternities_in_Nigeria) across the country, and then spread across Africa and the world in recent years.


While NBM started out with the goals of fighting racisms in the once British colony, the group, just like other Nigerian confraternities, adopted violent tactics and started delving into criminal activity.


Currently, NBM’s Black Axe is believed to be involved in prostitution, human trafficking, narcotics trafficking, grand theft, money laundering, and cybercrime (mainly email fraud), according to a 2020 Interpol report [[PDF](https://www.interpol.int/en/content/download/15525/file/Online%20African%20Organized%20Crime%20from%20Surface%20to%20Darkweb-17.08.2020.pdf)].

While members of the group have been arrested for cybercrime activities as far back as 2015, last week’s US arrests represent the biggest crackdown against Black Axe’s cybercrime operations.


The arrests also represent the second law enforcement crackdown against the group’s cybercrime operations this year, after Italian police also [arrested 30 Black Axe members in April](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-56895864).


Furthermore, the Black Axe arrests in the US represent the second crackdown against an international crime syndicate’s cybercrime operations. Just days before, Spanish and Italian police arrested [106 members of four Italian mafia organizations](https://therecord.media/106-italian-mafia-members-arrested-for-sim-swapping-bec-scams-phishing/) on cybercrime-related charges such as SIM swapping, BEC scams, phishing, and money laundering.
