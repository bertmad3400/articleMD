Dutch police have taken a rare step this week and sent letters to 29 individuals who used a now-defunct DDoS-for-hire service —*also known as a DDoS booter*— to launch DDoS attacks against various targets.


In the letters, Dutch officials warned users that they’d been added to a database of past miscreants, and any involvement in new DDoS attacks will lead to a criminal case.

The letters were sent to 29 Dutch nationals who registered accounts on the **MineSearch.rip** portal [[archived](https://web.archive.org/web/20200428153850/https://minesearch.rip/)], which Dutch authorities seized and took down [in July 2020](https://www.politie.nl/nieuws/2020/juli/30/03-doorzoekingen-woningen-in-zaak-ddos-aanbieder.html).


The investigation, started after a complaint from a gaming company, linked the site to two 19-year-old teenagers from Spijkenisse and Winschoten, both of whom were detained and had their computer equipment seized.


Today, Dutch police said they analyzed the seized data, and instead of starting criminal procedures against the site’s users, they’ve decided to give the 29 suspects one more chance.
