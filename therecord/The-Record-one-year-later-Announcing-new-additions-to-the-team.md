We launched The Record by Recorded Future last August with the goal of becoming the leader in cybersecurity news. One year later, hundreds of thousands of readers visit our site each month to catch up on breaking news, big stories, and behind-the-scenes exclusives about cybersecurity leaders, researchers, and the people in the shadows of the cyber underground.


We’ve published groundbreaking interviews with representatives from cybercrime gangs, including [REvil](https://therecord.media/i-scrounged-through-the-trash-heaps-now-im-a-millionaire-an-interview-with-revils-unknown/) and [BlackMatter](https://therecord.media/an-interview-with-blackmatter-a-new-ransomware-group-thats-learning-from-the-mistakes-of-darkside-and-revil/), delivered scoops on [NSA reviews](https://therecord.media/nsa-review-finds-that-tucker-carlsons-communications-were-not-targeted/) and [data breaches](https://therecord.media/hackers-leak-full-ea-data-after-failed-extortion-attempt/), and tracked the spread of [ransomware](https://therecord.media/ransomware-tracker-the-latest-figures/) and other attacks.


Our team has expanded along the way — [Catalin Cimpanu](https://therecord.media/catalin-cimpanu-joins-the-record-as-its-first-cybersecurity-reporter/) joined the publication from ZDNet in February, and we’ve brought on two additional team members over the last couple of months. Martin Matishak, who spent the last five years at Politico, covers the U.S. intelligence community, Congress, and the White House for The Record. Andrea Peterson, who previously worked at The Washington Post, the Project on Government Oversight and American Oversight, focuses on features and policy investigations, and will help expand The Record’s network of freelance contributors.

We’re also excited to announce one more addition to our team: Dina Temple-Raston, a correspondent at NPR who has covered national security, technology, social justice, and counter-terrorism at the media organization since 2007, will be joining The Record next week as a senior correspondent. Dina is a talented journalist and storyteller who has written four books, including *The Jihad Next Door: The Lackawanna Six and Rough Justice in an Age of Terror* and *A Death in Texas: A Story of Race, Murder and a Small Town’s Struggle for Redemption.* Prior to joining NPR, Dina served as a correspondent for Bloomberg News in China and was Bloomberg’s White House correspondent during the Clinton Administration. In addition to reporting on cybersecurity, national security, and China, Dina will be instrumental in building out The Record’s multimedia efforts, including podcasts and video content.


We hope you’re as excited as us about the new additions to the team, as well as the stories and projects that we’re thrilled to bring you in the year ahead.
