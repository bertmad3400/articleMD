Apple has released patches today for iOS, iPadOS, and macOS to address a zero-day vulnerability that the company says has been exploited in the wild.


Tracked as **CVE-2021-30807**, Apple said the zero-day impacts [IOMobileFramebuffer](https://iphonedev.wiki/index.php/IOMobileFramebuffer), a kernel extension that allows developers to control how a device’s memory handles the screen display—the screen [framebuffer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Framebuffer), to be more exact.


According to Apple, an application may exploit CVE-2021-30807 to execute arbitrary code with kernel privileges on a vulnerable and unpatched device.


Gaining access to kernel privileges effectively gives attackers full control over a device, may it be an iPhone, iPad, or macOS notebook or desktop.


In security advisories for [iOS/iPadOS](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT212623) and [macOS](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT212622) today, Apple said it was aware of a report that this vulnerability might have been exploited in the wild, but the company did not elaborate.


An Apple spokesperson did not return a request for comment seeking additional details.





Apple has released today macOS Big Sur 11.5.1, iOS 14.7.1, and iPadOS 14.7.1 to address the zero-day and the mysterious attacks. The updates are available for macOS notebooks and desktops, iPhone 6s and later, iPad Pro (all models), iPad Air 2 and later, iPad 5th generation and later, iPad mini 4 and later, and iPod touch (7th generation).


Today’s patches mark the 13th zero-day Apple has patched this year. Previous zero-days included:
