The operators of the Darkside and BlackMatter ransomware strains have moved a large chunk of their Bitcoin reserves after news broke that fellow ransomware gang REvil had its servers taken over by a coalition of law enforcement agencies.


Approximately 107 BTC ($6.8 million) were moved earlier today, according to Omri Segev Moyal, CEO and co-founder of security firm Profero.


“Basically, since 2AM UTC whoever controlled the [wallet](https://www.blockchain.com/btc/address/bc1q2sewgrnau4e4gvceh8ykzf8lqxawpluu0k0607) started to break the BTC into small chunks,” Moyal told *The Record*.


“At the time of this writing, the attackers split the funds into 7 wallets of 7-8 BTC and the rest (38BTC) is stored in the following wallet: [bc1q9jy4pq5su9slh56gryydwkk0qjnqxvfwzm7xl6](https://www.blockchain.com/btc/address/bc1q9jy4pq5su9slh56gryydwkk0qjnqxvfwzm7xl6).”

Moyal said he believed the funds were still controlled by the Darkside/BlackMatter gang and were being prepared to be laundered or cashed out.


He said that law enforcement agencies typically move seized assets to a new wallet under their control and wouldn’t need to break the funds into smaller chunks, a step typical in money laundering operations.


### Darkside moves $6.8 million, fearing a repeat


The funds were moved roughly six hours after [Reuters reported](https://www.reuters.com/technology/exclusive-governments-turn-tables-ransomware-gang-revil-by-pushing-it-offline-2021-10-21/) that a coalition of law enforcement agencies from several countries was responsible for hijacking the servers of fellow ransomware group REvil [over the weekend](https://therecord.media/revil-gang-shuts-down-for-the-second-time-after-its-tor-servers-were-hacked/).


The Darkside group’s quick reaction to move funds and re-asses control is justifiable in light of the gang’s history and past attacks.


Darkside was the ransomware strain used in the incident that crippled the operations of [Colonial Pipeline in May](https://therecord.media/fbi-colonial-pipeline-was-hit-with-darkside-ransomware/), an attack that indirectly caused fuel supply outages across the US East Coast.


In light of the attack and its political repercussions, the Darkside gang shut down its operations a week later. At the time, the gang claimed they shut down after they [lost control over some servers and some cryptocurrency wallets](https://therecord.media/darkside-ransomware-gang-says-it-lost-control-of-its-servers-money-a-day-after-biden-threat/) (money).


Nevertheless, the gang re-launched in July with new infrastructure and under the new name of [BlackMatter](https://therecord.media/blackmatter-ransomware-targets-companies-with-revenues-of-100-million-and-more/).


Moving some of its funds shortly after the REvil takedown news makes sense since the gang would like to make sure they don’t lose funds for a second time, during another law enforcement crackdown.


Moyal has now notified and asked cryptocurrency exchanges to block the Darkside/BlackMatter wallets holding their new funds, but the fractured cryptocurrency exchange landscape still leaves many ways for the group to launder its profits.
