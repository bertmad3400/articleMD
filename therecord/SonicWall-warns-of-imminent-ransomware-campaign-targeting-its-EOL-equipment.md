Networking equipment vendor SonicWall has released an urgent security alert to its customers to warn companies of “**an imminent ransomware campaing**” targeting some of its equipment.



> Through the course of collaboration with trusted third parties, SonicWall has been made aware of threat actors actively targeting Secure Mobile Access (SMA) 100 series and Secure Remote Access (SRA) products running unpatched and end-of-life (EOL) 8.x firmware in **an imminent ransomware campaign** using stolen credentials.

The company, which also operates a cybersecurity division, said the attackers are targeting a vulnerability that has been fixed in recent versions of its firmware. It did not specify what was the vulnerability, nor its CVE identifier.


Instead, SonicWall is now urging customers to update their devices’ firmware as soon as possible if a new firmware version is available.


“If your organization is using a legacy SRA appliance that is past end-of life status and cannot update to 9.x firmware, **continued use may result in ransomware exploitation**,” the company warned.


If customers can’t update, SonicWall is recommending that they disconnect devices immediately and reset their access passwords, and enable account multi-factor authentication, if supported.


“The affected end-of-life devices with 8.x firmware are past temporary mitigations. Continued use of this firmware or end-of-life devices is an active security risk,” it added.


Based on what type of SonicWall equipment companies are using, SonicWall has made the following recommendations:


* **SRA 4600/1600** (EOL 2019)
	+ Disconnect immediately
	+ Reset passwords
* **SRA 4200/1200** (EOL 2016)
	+ Disconnect immediately
	+ Reset passwords
* **SSL-VPN 200/2000/400** (EOL 2013/2014)
	+ Disconnect immediately
	+ Reset passwords
* **SMA 400/200** (Still Supported, in Limited Retirement Mode)
	+ Update to **10.2.0.7-34** or**9.0.0.10** immediately
	+ Reset passwords
	+ Enable MFA


SonicWall has also warned customers of SMA 210/410/500v devices, which are still under active support, to also update their devices to 9.x or 10.x firmware versions and not run the older 8.x firmware, as they could also be attacked and ransomed, even if the device is not EOL.


Today’s SonicWall alert about the current equipment exploitation and impending ransomware attacks are the third major hacking operation aimed at the company’s products discovered this year.


[In late January 2021](https://www.zdnet.com/article/sonicwall-says-it-was-hacked-using-zero-days-in-its-own-products/), the company previously disclosed that it was itself hacked using a zero-day in its Secure Mobile Access (SMA) gateways. A week later, security firm NCC Group detected threat actors exploiting [a mysterious SonicWall zero-day](https://www.zdnet.com/article/sonicwall-zero-day-exploited-in-the-wild/) in its SMA devices. At the time, SonicWall wasn’t even able to tell if the two zero-days were the same, as pointed out by infosec podcast [Risky Business.](https://srslyriskybiz.substack.com/p/newsletter42)


In April, FireEye discovered that a hacking group was using [three SonicWall zero-days](https://therecord.media/hackers-go-after-sonicwall-email-appliances-with-three-zero-days/) to breach corporate networks.
