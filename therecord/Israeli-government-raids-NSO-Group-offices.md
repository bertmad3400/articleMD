Officials from multiple Israeli government agencies have raided today the offices of surveillance software vendor NSO Group, the Israeli Ministry of Defense announced today.


The raids have taken place after a consortium of international journalists [revealed earlier this month](https://forbiddenstories.org/case/the-pegasus-project/) that NSO Group had sold access to its software —the Pegasus platform— to oppressive governments across the world, which abused it to spy on journalists, human rights activists, and political rivals.


“We can confirm that representatives from the Israeli Ministry of Defense visited our offices,” an NSO spokesperson confirmed to *The Record* today earlier today.


“We welcome their inspection,” the NSO Group said.


“The company is working in full ransparency with the Israeli authorities. We are confident that this inspection will prove the facts are as declared repeatedly by the company against the false allegations made against us in the recent media attacks.”


The raids targeted NSO Group’s Herzliya offices, near the city of Tel Aviv.


The nature of the raids or who participated was not disclosed. The raids were announced through a simple tweet by the Israeli Ministry of Defence earlier today. Machine-translated, the tweet reads as:


Representatives from a number of bodies came to NSO today to examine the publications and allegations raised in its case.





The company holds a legal license in Israel to export surveillance software.


[In July 2020](https://www.business-humanrights.org/en/latest-news/israel-court-rejects-case-to-revoke-spyware-firm-nso-groups-export-license/), an Israeli court rejected a case filed by several human rights groups to revoke the company’s license after similar abuses as those exposed this month were discovered in previous years.


The raids today are not an indication that the company might have violated its export license, and that Israeli officials are going through due diligence in a case that has received international attention.


The raids also come after it was discovered that NSO’s customers might have targeted the personal smartphones of several heads of state, [including French President Emanuel Macron](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/jul/20/emmanuel-macron-identified-in-leaked-pegasus-project-data), who later [lobbied Israeli government officials](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/jul/25/emmanuel-macron-pushes-for-israeli-inquiry-into-nso-spyware-concerns) to look into the matter.
