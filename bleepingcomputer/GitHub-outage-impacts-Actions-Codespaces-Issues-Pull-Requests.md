​GitHub was down today, affected by a worldwide outage preventing access to the website, issuing commits, cloning projects, or performing pull requests.


The outage started at approximately 2:15 PM EST, with the website responding with HTTP 500 error codes, as shown below.

Attempts to clone or commit to existing GitHub projects also failed with HTTP 500 error codes.


It is unclear what caused the outage, with the [GitHub status page](https://www.githubstatus.com/) only stating that they were investigating degraded performance for GitHub Actions, Codespaces, Issues, and Pull Requests.
