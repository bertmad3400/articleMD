Microsoft is offering discounts of up to 50% on Microsoft 365 subscriptions to those using pirated versions of Microsoft Office willing to switch to a genuine version.


This promotional offer is sent to Office users if Microsoft detects the version installed is non-genuine, and it shows as an alert under the top menu as first reported by [Ghacks](https://www.ghacks.net/2021/12/03/pirated-versions-of-office-are-getting-a-discount-offer-for-a-microsoft-365-subscription/).


The message displayed is a call to action for those likely using a pirate copy of Microsoft Office: "GET UP TO 50% OFF. For a limited time, save up to 50% on a genuine Microsoft 365 subscription." 


When clicked, the alert sends you to a [Microsoft 365 landing page](https://www.microsoft.com/en-US/microsoft-365/buy/get-genuine-b?ocid=prod_unlicensed_cons_fuel_acq_getgenuine50_buy&rtc=1) warning that pirated software can expose your computer to security threats.


Among the risks behind counterfeit software, Redmond says you'll be prone to higher exposure to virus and malware attacks, identity theft, corrupted files and data loss, and the inability to receive critical updates or edit files, all of these being legitimate points.


The 50% discount is applied at checkout for the first year of an annual subscription on Microsoft 365 Family ($99.99/year) subscriptions for up to six users with 6TB of cloud storage and Microsoft 365 Personal ($69.99/year) subscriptions for one person with 1TB of storage.

With this strategy, Microsoft is likely trying to kill two birds with one stone: this will get more paying Office customers and, just as importantly, it will also increase the number of active subscriptions for the company's cloud services.


While some of those using non-genuine Microsoft Office software will likely not budge and will keep using it, others will probably find the discounted prices appealing enough to get a subscription and join Redmond's customer base.


Microsoft also [links to a separate page on its support website](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/stay-safe-with-a-genuine-office-license-f2c36e89-d113-4dbf-8e1c-86f7700bf647) with details on measures to be taken by those whose Office software who paid for a license but still had it tagged as non-genuine.


To fix this issue, you will have to completely uninstall and reinstall Office to ensure all traces of the counterfeit version are removed using the steps outlined [here](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/stay-safe-with-a-genuine-office-license-f2c36e89-d113-4dbf-8e1c-86f7700bf647#bkmk_sarauninstall).


Microsoft also provides a short video (embedded below) highlighting the risk Office users expose themselves to when using pirated software.
