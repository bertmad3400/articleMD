Akamai is investigating an ongoing outage affecting many major websites and online services, including Steam, the PlayStation Network, Newegg, Cloudflare, AWS, Amazon, Google, and Salesforce.


While the company has already acknowledged the issue, pinning it on an Edge DNS service problem, Akamai is still trying to find the underlying cause behind the incident.


"We are aware of an emerging issue with the Edge DNS service," the company said in an [Edge DNS Service Incident](https://edgedns.status.akamai.com/incidents/n5zl6dythvfv) notice.


"We are actively investigating the issue. If you have questions or are experiencing impact due to this issue, please contact Akamai Technical Support.


"In the interest of time, we are providing you the most current information available, which is subject to changes, corrections, and updates."


According to Akamai, [Edge DNS](https://learn.akamai.com/en-us/products/cloud_security/edge_dns.html) is its cloud-based authoritative DNS solution designed to provide 24/7 DNS availability and improve DNS responsiveness.

Akamai also confirmed this issue on Twitter, saying that they will provide an update in the next 30 minutes.

The company has now implemented a fix to address the ongoing issue and expects service to return to normal for all customers.

Last month, another [worldwide outage that hit Fastly CDN's servers](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/stackoverflow-twitch-reddit-others-down-in-fastly-cdn-outage/) impacted a long list of sites and online services, including BleepingComputer.
