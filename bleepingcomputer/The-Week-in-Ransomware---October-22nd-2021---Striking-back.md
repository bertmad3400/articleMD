Between law enforcement operations, REvil's second shut down, and ransomware gangs' response to the hacking of their servers, it has been quite the week.


This week's biggest news is the Reuters report that international law enforcement operation that took over REvil's Tor infrastructure, which ultimately led to the [shutdown of the ransomware again](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/revil-ransomware-shuts-down-again-after-tor-sites-were-hijacked/) last Sunday.


Since then, reactions have been coming in from other ransomware operations, such as [Groove](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/groove-ransomware-calls-on-all-extortion-gangs-to-attack-us-interests/), [Conti](https://twitter.com/BleepinComputer/status/1451661008972484609), and [Arvin Club](https://twitter.com/BleepinComputer/status/1451661015276478469).


DarkSide also appears to have reacted to the law enforcement operation by attempting to [cash out $7 million in Bitcoin](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/darkside-ransomware-rushes-to-cash-out-7-million-in-bitcoin/) sitting in a wallet.


This week we also learned of an [attack on the Sinclair Broadcast Group](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/sinclair-tv-stations-crippled-by-weekend-ransomware-attack/) that disrupted the broadcasting of shows and newscasts. This attack was conducted by a new Evil Corp ransomware known as [Macaw Ransomware who has been seen demanding a $40 million ransom](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/evil-corp-demands-40-million-in-new-macaw-ransomware-attacks/) from an unidentified victim.


Interesting research we saw this week is that the [Karma Ransomware is a rebrand of Nemty](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/new-karma-ransomware-group-likely-a-nemty-rebrand/) and how FIN7 created a fake company to hire legitimate security professionals to conduct ransomware attacks unknowingly.
