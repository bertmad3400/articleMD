Microsoft has released the optional KB5006738 Preview cumulative update for Windows 10 2004, Windows 10 20H2, and Windows 10 21H1.


Microsoft says this update and a separate Windows Server preview update will fix all outstanding printing issues affecting users since they mitigated the [PrintNightmare vulnerabilities](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/printnightmare/).


The KB5006738 cumulative update is part of Microsoft's September 2021 monthly "C" update, allowing Windows users to test upcoming fixes before they are released as part of the upcoming November 2021 Patch Tuesday.


Unlike Patch Tuesday updates, the "C" preview updates are optional and do not include any security updates.


Windows users can install this update by going into **Settings**, clicking on **Windows Update,** and manually performing a **'Check for Updates**.'


As this is an optional update, you will be asked whether you wish to install it by clicking on the 'Download and install' link, as shown in the image below.
