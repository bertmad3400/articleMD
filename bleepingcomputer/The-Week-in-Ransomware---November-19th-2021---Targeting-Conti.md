While last week was full of arrests and law enforcement actions, this week has been much quieter, with mostly new research released.


Security firms released reports on the types of [cryptomixers used by ransomware gangs](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/these-are-the-cryptomixers-hackers-use-to-clean-their-ransoms/), a detailed [report on Conti](https://www.prodaft.com/resource/detail/conti-ransomware-group-depth-analysis), and how Russian ransomware gangs are starting to [work with Chinese hackers](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/russian-ransomware-gangs-start-collaborating-with-chinese-hackers/).


Today, US regulators also [ordered banks to report cyber attacks](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/us-regulators-order-banks-to-report-cyberattacks-within-36-hours/) within 36 hours if they impact their operations, the ability to deliver banking products and services, or the US financial sector's stability.


Finally, a Tor negotiation site for the Conti ransomware gang was taken down, likely due to the release of its IP address in the PRODAFT report.
