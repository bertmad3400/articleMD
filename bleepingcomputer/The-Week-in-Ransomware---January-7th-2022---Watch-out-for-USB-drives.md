With the holidays these past two weeks, there have been only a few known ransomware attacks and little research released.


At the end of December, a new enterprise-targeting ransomware operation [called Night Sky](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/night-sky-is-the-latest-ransomware-targeting-corporate-networks/) was launched, but it is not very active so far.


We also saw an increase in Qlocker and eCh0raix campaigns targeting QNAP NAS devices, leading to [QNAP releasing a security advisory](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/qnap-warns-of-ransomware-targeting-internet-exposed-nas-devices/).


The most noteworthy information that came out today is a new FBI flash alert warning that REvil and BlackMatter were [sending malicious USB drives to defense firms](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/fbi-hackers-target-us-defense-firms-with-malicious-usb-packages/) that deployed ransomware.


Finally, there have been a few ransomware attacks over the past two weeks, including [FinalSite](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/finalsite-ransomware-attack-shuts-down-thousands-of-school-websites/), [Bernalillo County](https://statescoop.com/bernalillo-county-new-mexico-first-ransomware-2022/), and [SIC](https://statescoop.com/bernalillo-county-new-mexico-first-ransomware-2022/).


Now that the holidays are over, we can expect to see more attacks by threat actors and research related to new TTPs.
