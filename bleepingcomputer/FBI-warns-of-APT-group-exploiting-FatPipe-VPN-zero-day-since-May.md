The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) warned of an advanced persistent threat (APT) compromising FatPipe router clustering and load balancer products to breach targets' networks.


FatPipe is a Salt Lake City computer networking hardware firm headquartered specializing in WAN optimization solutions with many Fortune 1000 companies on its customer list.


Organizations from all major industry sectors use FatPipe products, including government and military entities, municipalities, utilities, educational facilities, and financial and medical institutions.


"As of November 2021, FBI forensic analysis indicated exploitation of a 0-day vulnerability in the FatPipe MPVPN device software going back to at least May 2021," the FBI said in a [flash alert](https://www.ic3.gov/Media/News/2021/211117-2.pdf) issued this week.


"The vulnerability allowed APT actors to gain access to an unrestricted file upload function to drop a webshell for exploitation activity with root access, leading to elevated privileges and potential follow-on activity."


Compromised VPNs used for lateral movement
------------------------------------------


After hacking into vulnerable FatPipe devices, the attackers used them to move laterally into their targets' networks.


The zero-day bug exploited in these attacks impacts all FatPipe WARP, MPVPN, and IPVPN device software before the latest releases 10.1.2r60p93 and 10.2.2r44p1.


The vulnerability doesn't yet have a CVE ID but, according to the FBI, FatPipe patched it this month and released a security advisory tracked under the FPSA006 tag.


However, FatPipe's advisories page only includes advice on how customers can secure their devices by using strong admin passwords and disabling the FatPipe User Interface and SSH console access from the WAN when not in use.


"We have the software upgrade available to address the vulnerability and several other hardening features for security enhancements. Please let us know when we can schedule an upgrade for you," FatPipe [says](http://www.fatpipeinc.com/support/advisories.php).


Yesterday, the FBI also warned in a joint advisory with US, UK, and Australian cybersecurity agencies that an Iranian-backed hacking group is [actively exploiting Microsoft Exchange ProxyShell and Fortinet vulnerabilities](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/us-uk-warn-of-iranian-hackers-exploiting-microsoft-exchange-fortinet/).
