Microsoft released Windows 11 preview build 22000.282 yesterday with fixes for AMD CPU performance issues and a bug that displayed the Windows 10 taskbar.


This build is available to Windows Insiders in the Beta and Release channels and fixes a long list of bugs plaguing users since Windows 11 was released.


However, two fixed bugs that stand out in this release are for AMD CPU performance issues and a weird bug displaying the Windows 10 taskbar in Windows 11.


AMD CPU performance issues partially fixed
------------------------------------------


Since Windows 11 was released, users complained of a [noticeable performance drop with AMD Ryzen CPUs](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/microsoft/amd-warns-of-up-to-15-percent-windows-11-performance-decrease/).


Soon after, AMD published a [support article](http://web.archive.org/web/20211006195809/https://www.amd.com/en/support/kb/faq/pa-400) stating that "L3 cache latency may increase for some applications" and "UEFI CPPC2 ("preferred core") may not preferentially schedule threads on a processor's fastest core."


The L3 cache latency issue was significant, with AMD [originally stating](http://web.archive.org/web/20211006195809/https://www.amd.com/en/support/kb/faq/pa-400) it could cause up to a 15% decrease in performance in games commonly used for eSports.


Microsoft has now fixed the L3 caching issue in Windows 11 build 22000.282, but a fix for the preferred core issue remains outstanding.


"We fixed an L3 caching issue that might affect performance in some applications on devices that have AMD Ryzen processors after upgrading to Windows 11 (original release)," explains the [release notes](https://blogs.windows.com/windows-insider/2021/10/15/releasing-windows-11-build-22000-282-to-beta-and-release-preview-channels/) for the Windows 11 22000.282 build.


This fix should become available to Windows 11 users outside of the Insider program later this month when Microsoft releases the optional cumulative update preview.


Microsoft and AMD have also stated that fixes for both issues should be available by the end of this month, so we should expect to see a further fix coming for the "UEFI CPPC2 (“preferred core”)" bug coming soon.


Start Menu and Windows 10 taskbar bug fixed
-------------------------------------------


Windows 11 comes with a controversial new taskbar and Start Menu that is centered by default. While some people like the new look, others have complained that it [lacks many of the features of Windows 10](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/microsoft/windows-11-is-coming-soon-but-users-want-these-features-back/).


After upgrading to Windows 11, a bug is causing the operating system to show the Windows 10 taskbar for some users, while everything else uses the new Windows 11 user interface design.

Users who encountered this bug also found that they could not use the Start Menu, with clicking on it, not do anything.


In Windows 11 build 22000.282, Microsoft states that they have fixed this bug, and users should now see the new taskbar and open the Start Menu.


"We fixed an issue for a small number of users that prevents the Start menu from working and prevents you from seeing the updated taskbar design after upgrading to Windows 11 (original release)," reads the Windows 11 build's release notes.


This fix will also likely become available to users at the end of the month in the optional schedule "C" release of the Windows 11 cumulative update preview.
