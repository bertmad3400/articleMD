Discord is suffering a 'massive outage' preventing users from logging in to the service or using voice chats.


The outage started at 2:49 PM EST and was originally caused by a widespread API outage.


However, after resolving the issue, Discord reported that they discovered a problem with one of their database clusters, causing further issues.


"We have identified the underlying issue with the API outage but are dealing with a secondary issue on one of our database clusters. We have our entire on-call response team online and responding to the issue," Discord explained on their [status page](https://discordstatus.com/).


Users who attempt to log into Discord are met with a spinning logo, which ultimately shows a message about the outage.

Discord states that they have begun rate limiting logins to prevent an overload of their servers while fixing the problematic database cluster.
