This week marked the return of the notorious REvil ransomware group, who disappeared in July after conducting a massive attack using a Kaseya zero-day vulnerability.


Their July attack affected over 1,500 businesses and drew the full attention of international law enforcement and the White House, who demanded that Russia do something about these attacks.


Soon after, [REvil shut down all of its servers](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/revil-ransomware-gangs-web-sites-mysteriously-shut-down/) and mysteriously disappeared.


That is until this week when [REvil's servers started back up](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/revil-ransomwares-servers-mysteriously-come-back-online/), and a new sample of their ransomware was spotted on VirusTotal.


It is still too soon to tell if the ransomware gang is fully operational, but we will likely see new attacks shortly.


In other news, a report was released this week outlining what a [ransomware gang's ideal target](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/ransomware-gangs-target-companies-using-these-criteria/) is for attacks, and [the Ragnar Locker gang threatened](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/ransomware-gang-threatens-to-leak-data-if-victim-contacts-fbi-police/) to automatically release stolen data if victims contact negotiators or law enforcement.

### Ransomware gangs target companies using these criteria


Ransomware gangs increasingly purchase access to a victim's network on dark web marketplaces and from other threat actors. Analyzing their want ads makes it possible to get an inside look at the types of companies ransomware operations are targeting for attacks.

### REvil ransomware's servers mysteriously come back online


The dark web servers for the REvil ransomware operation have suddenly turned back on after an almost two-month absence. It is unclear if this marks their ransomware gang's return or the servers being turned on by law enforcement.


### Ransomware gang threatens to leak data if victim contacts FBI, police


The Ragnar Locker ransomware group is warning that they will leak stolen data from victims that contact law enforcement authorities, like the FBI.

### Howard University shuts down network after ransomware attack


The private Howard University in Washington disclosed that it suffered a ransomware attack late last week and is currently working to restore affected systems.


### How Groove Gang is Shaking up the Ransomware-as-a-Service Market to Empower Affiliates


McAfee Enterprise ATR believes, with high confidence, that the Groove gang is associated with the Babuk gang, either as a former affiliate or subgroup. These cybercriminals are happy to put aside previous Ransomware-as-a-Service hierarchies to focus on the ill-gotten gains to be made from controlling victim’s networks, rather than the previous approach which prioritized control of the ransomware itself.
