Microsoft has released the optional KB5005101 Preview cumulative update for Windows 10 2004, Windows 10 20H2, and Windows 10 21H1 with fixes for thirty-four issues.


This preview update is part of Microsoft's June 2021 monthly "C" update, allowing Windows 10 users to test the upcoming fixes and changes to be released on September 14th as part of Patch Tuesday.


Unlike updates released on Patch Tuesday, this preview update is optional and only contains bug fixes, performance enhancements, and improvements. It does not include any security updates.


You can install this update by going to **Settings** > **Windows Update**and clicking on **'Check for Updates**.' As this is an optional update, you will need to click on the 'Download and install' link for the update to be installed, as shown below.

Windows 10 users can also manually download and install the KB5005101 preview update from the [Microsoft Update Catalog](https://www.catalog.update.microsoft.com/Search.aspx?q=KB5005101).


Bluetooth and USB headphone issues fixed
----------------------------------------


This update tests two fixes for issues Windows 10 users have been experiencing with Bluetooth and USB headphones.


"Addresses an issue that prevents USB audio headsets from working on devices that support USB audio offload. This issue occurs if you installed third-party audio drivers on the devices," explained Microsoft in the KB5005101 support bulletin.


"Addresses a rare condition that prevents Bluetooth headsets from connecting using the Advanced Audio Distribution Profile (A2DP) for music playback and causes the headsets to only work for voice calls."


These issues do not appear to be common, but will likely be eagerly awaited fixes with many people working remotely.
