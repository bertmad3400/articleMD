Microsoft Defender for Business, a new endpoint security solution specially built for small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs), is now rolling out in preview worldwide.


It helps businesses with up to 300 employees defend against cybersecurity threats, including ransomware, malware, and phishing, across Windows, macOS, iOS, and Android devices.


It has a simplified client configuration via wizard-driven setup, and it comes with all recommended security policies enabled out-of-the-box, which makes it simple to use even by organizations without a dedicated security team.


Microsoft [first announced](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/microsoft/microsoft-announces-new-endpoint-security-solution-for-smbs/) Defender for Business last month and released it in response to the 300% increase in ransomware attacks in the previous year, with [over 50% of them directly impacting SMBs](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/dhs-secretary-warns-ransomware-attacks-rise-targets-include/story?id=77512872), according to US Secretary of Homeland Security Alejandro Mayorkas.


Microsoft says the new enterprise-grade endpoint security solution for SMBs is rolling out worldwide to customers and IT partners who request access by [signing up here](https://aka.ms/MDB-Preview).


After it reaches general availability, Defender for Business will be available directly from Microsoft and Microsoft Partner Cloud Solution Provider (CSP) channels at $3 per user per month, through a standalone license or included within Microsoft 365 Business Premium.

"We will onboard an initial set of customers and partners in the coming weeks and will expand the preview leading up to general availability.
