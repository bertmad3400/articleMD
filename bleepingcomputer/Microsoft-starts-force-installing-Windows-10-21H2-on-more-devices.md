Microsoft has started the forced rollout of Windows 10, version 21H2 to more devices approaching the end of service (EOS) as part of a first machine learning (ML) training phase.


The automated feature update rollout phase comes after Windows 10 20H2 [became available for broad deployment](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/microsoft/windows-10-20h2-now-in-broad-deployment-available-to-everyone/) to everyone in May 2021 via Windows Update.


Windows 10 21H2 is also rolling out to seekers (users who manually check for updates) on Windows 10 2004 or newer through a fast update experience similar to a monthly update.


Forced deployment on devices reaching EOS
-----------------------------------------


Microsoft started the [forced rollout of Windows 10 20H2](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/microsoft/microsoft-starts-force-installing-windows-10-20h2-on-more-devices/) using the same machine learning-based rollout process to devices running Windows 10 1909 and earlier in March 2021.


Now, computers running Windows versions closing their end of service will be automatically upgraded to Windows 10 21H2.


"[We] started the first phase in our rollout for machine learning (ML) training, targeting devices on Windows 10, version 20H2 that are approaching end of servicing to update automatically to Windows 10, version 21H2," Microsoft [says](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/release-health/status-windows-10-21h2).


"We will continue to train our machine learning model through all phases to intelligently rollout new versions of Windows 10, and deliver a smooth update experience."


According to the [Windows 10, version 20H2 health dashboard](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/release-health/status-windows-10-20h2), devices running Windows 10, version 20H2 (Home, Pro, Pro Education, and Pro for Workstations) will be the ones to get automatically upgraded in the coming months as they reach the end of servicing on May 10, 2022.


Microsoft is automatically deploying this feature update to ensure that it can adequately service these devices with the latest updates, security updates, and improvements.


No compatibility holds still in place
-------------------------------------


Windows Servicing and Delivery Director of Program Management John Cable [revealed](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/microsoft/microsoft-releases-windows-10-version-1903-may-2019-update/) that Microsoft usually starts "this machine learning (ML)-based rollout process several months in advance of the end of service date to provide adequate time for a smooth update process."


If you are running a Windows 10 version nearing EoS and you're not offered to update via Window Update, you should manually check for an update to Windows 10 21H2 via the Windows Update dialog.


"As always, we recommend that you update your devices to the latest version of [Windows 10](https://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/?p=176473) or upgrade eligible devices to [Windows 11](https://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/2021/10/04/how-to-get-windows-11/) to take advantage of the latest features and advanced protections from the latest security threats," the company added.


You can use this [Windows support document](http://support.microsoft.com/help/4089834) to troubleshoot Windows 10 21H2 update problems or follow this [guided walk-through](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/10164/fix-windows-update-errors) to fix any errors you encounter.
