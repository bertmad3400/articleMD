Microsoft reminded customers today that multiple editions of Windows 10, version 20H2 and Windows 10, version 1909 are quickly approaching the end of servicing (EOS).


In a [support document](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-US/lifecycle/announcements/windows-10-20h2-end-of-servicing) updated today, Microsoft stated that Windows 10 20H2 (also known as the October 2020 Update) will reach EOS on May 10, 2022.


This announcement applies to Windows 10 Home, Pro, Pro, Pro Education, and Pro for Workstations users. It's also worth noting that Enterprise, Education, and IoT Enterprise editions will reach EOS on May 9, 2023.


In a [separate notification](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-US/lifecycle/announcements/windows-10-1909-enterprise-education-eos), Redmond added that Enterprise, Education, and IoT Enterprise editions of Windows 10 1909 will also reach their end of servicing on May 10, 2022 (Windows 10 1909 Home, Pro, Pro Education, and Pro for Workstations [reached EOS in May 2021](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/microsoft/microsoft-windows-10-1809-and-1909-have-reached-end-of-service/)).


"These editions will no longer receive security updates after May 10, 2022. Customers who contact Microsoft Support after this date will be directed to update their device to the latest version of Windows 10 to remain supported," Microsoft explained.


Forced updates for devices reaching EOS
---------------------------------------


Until these editions of Windows 10 1909 and 20H2 reach EOS, Windows Update will force feature updates on consumer devices and non-managed business devices that reach the end of servicing.


This way, Microsoft ensures that these systems remain supported and receive critical monthly updates, security updates, and improvements. When the feature update is initiated, customers will be able to choose a convenient restart time to complete the update.


More information regarding end of service dates for supported versions of Windows 10 is available in the [Windows Lifecycle FAQ](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/lifecycle/faq/windows), the [Windows 10 Servicing Frequently Asked Questions](https://support.microsoft.com/help/4035050/windows-10-serviced-versions-frequently-asked-questions), and via [Microsoft's Lifecycle Policy search tool](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/lifecycle/products/?terms=windows).


Redmond also provides customers with a complete [list of all products ending support or that will be retired in 2022](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/lifecycle/end-of-support/end-of-support-2022). 


Windows 10 21H2 forced deployment
---------------------------------


On January 21, Microsoft announced that it had [started a forced rollout of Windows 10, version 21H2](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/microsoft/microsoft-starts-force-installing-windows-10-21h2-on-more-devices/) to more devices reaching EOS as part of a first machine learning (ML) training phase.


Windows 10 21H2 is also rolling out to seekers (Windows users who manually check for updates) on Windows 10 2004 or later through a fast update experience very similar to monthly updates.


If you're running a Windows 10 version nearing EoS and you're not offered to automatically update, you should manually check for an update via the Windows Update dialog.


[Windows 11 21H2 also entered the broad deployment phase](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/microsoft/microsoft-windows-11-now-in-broad-deployment-for-eligible-devices/) on January 27 and is now available for all customers with an eligible device via Windows Update.


"As always, we recommend that you update your devices to the latest version of Windows 10 or upgrade eligible devices to Windows 11 to take advantage of the latest features and advanced protections from the latest security threats," the company said in January.


You can easily check if your Windows 10 device is eligible for a Windows 11 upgrade using the [PC Health Check app](https://www.microsoft.com/windows/windows-11#pchealthcheck) or by visiting the [Windows 11 specs, features, and computer requirements](https://www.microsoft.com/windows/windows-11-specifications) page.
