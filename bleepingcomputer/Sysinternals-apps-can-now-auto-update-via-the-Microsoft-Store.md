​Microsoft added their Sysinternals Suite to the Microsoft Store, allowing the popular Sysinternals utilities to be updated automatically as new versions are released.


Sysinternals offers a wide variety of advanced system utilities that let you perform administrative tasks in Windows or get detailed information about the internal functions and processes of the operating system.


Some of the well-known Sysinternals utilities include:


* **Process Explorer** - A graphical utility that allows you to see what processes are running on a computer, what DLLs they have loaded, and more.
* **Process Monitor** - View file system, Registry, process, and thread activity in real time.
* **Sysmon** - Monitors system activity for various behavior and activity, which is then logged to the Windows Event Log.
* **PSExec** - Allows you to execute commands on remote systems.


Sysinternals' utilities can be downloaded as an all-in-one package called Sysinternals Suite, or individually from [their website](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/) or the <https://live.sysinternals.com/> site.


Sysinternals Suite now auto-updated
-----------------------------------


The Sysinternals utilities are updated often, but none offer a built-in automatic update feature, forcing users to manually download new versions as they are released.


Starting this week, Microsoft now offers the [Sysinternals Suite in the Microsoft Store](https://www.microsoft.com/store/productId/9P7KNL5RWT25) on Windows 10 and Windows 11, allowing the utilities to be automatically updated as new versions are released.

After installing the Sysinternals Suite, users will get access to the following individual utilities.


As new versions of the individual utilities are released, Microsoft will repackage them into the Sysinternals Suite, which will then be updated via the Microsoft Store.


By installing the utilities in this manner, you will no longer have to find newer versions and download them manually.


For those using the Winget, you can now update the Sysinternals Suite through the package manager as well.
