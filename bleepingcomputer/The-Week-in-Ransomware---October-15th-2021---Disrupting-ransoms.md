This week, senior officials from over thirty countries held virtual conferences on disrupting ransomware operations and attacks.


[Russia and China were left out of these talks](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/russia-and-china-left-out-of-global-anti-ransomware-meetings/), even though there are signs that Russia has begun to crack down on cybercriminal activity in its country.


Through these talks, [senior officials announced](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/governments-worldwide-to-crack-down-on-ransomware-payment-channels/) that governments will be disrupting ransomware operations through intelligence sharing, cryptocurrency seizures, anti-money laundering operations, and more scrutiny into the exploitation of cryptocurrency.


This disruption is necessary, as the U.S. Treasury Department's Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) has [linked a staggering $5.2 billion in Bitcoin transactions](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/us-links-52-billion-worth-of-bitcoin-transactions-to-ransomware/) to ransomware operations.


There have been quite a few attacks this week, likely the result of ransomware.


This week's most prominent [attack is against Banco Pichincha](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/cyberattack-shuts-down-ecuadors-largest-bank-banco-pichincha/), Ecuador's largest private bank, where a ransomware attack severely disrupted operations.


Other attacks that have not been confirmed to be ransomware are [Olympus U.S.](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/olympus-us-systems-hit-by-cyberattack-over-the-weekend/) and the [University of Sunderland](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/university-of-sunderland-announces-outage-following-cyberattack/).
