This week has quite a bit of ransomware news, including arrests, a new and sophisticated ransomware, and an attack bringing down 300 supermarkets in England.


This week's biggest story is a law enforcement operation conducted by the FBI and Ontario Provincial Police (OPP) [that arrested a Candian ransomware affiliate](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/alleged-ransomware-affiliate-arrested-for-healthcare-attacks/) allegedly involved in hundreds of attacks.


We also learned about the [new ALPHV (aka BlackCat) ransomware](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/alphv-blackcat-this-years-most-sophisticated-ransomware/) that appears to be one of the most sophisticated ransomware families we have seen this year.


Finally, this week's largest known ransomware attack was on James Hall and Co, which affected point-of-sale systems and led to the temporary [closing of over 300 Spar supermarkets in England](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/hundreds-of-spar-stores-shut-down-switch-to-cash-after-cyberattack/). This week's other known attack is on [Nordic Choice Hotels](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/nordic-choice-hotels-hit-by-conti-ransomware-no-ransom-demand-yet/) by the Conti ransomware gang.
