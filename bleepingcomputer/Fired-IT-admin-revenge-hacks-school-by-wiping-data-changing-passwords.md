![IT admin attacks school and company in revenge hack after being fired](https://www.bleepstatic.com/content/hl-images/2021/05/01/hacking.jpg)


A 29-year old wiped data on systems of a secondary school in the U.K. and changed the passwords at an IT company, in retaliatory cyber attacks for being fired.


As a result of his actions, the school’s systems could no longer be accessed and remote learning was impacted at a time when pupils were at home due to the Covid-19 pandemic.


### Repeat offender


At the beginning of the year on January 16, Adam Georgeson downloaded and deleted data from computers belonging to Welland Park Academy in Market Harborough, Leicestershire, and changed passwords of staff members.


Georgeson had been working as an IT technician at the school but had been fired at the time of the attack.


On January 21, while employed at an IT company in Rutland, Georgeson was arrested for his actions on the school’s network.


However, his new employment did not last long because he was sacked in February and he once again trespassed the digital grounds of his former employer.


On March 9, the company reported unauthorized activity on its network. Apart from changing passwords that locked users out, Georgeson also modified the phone system used to contact customers.


Georgeson appeared at Leicester Crown Court on Monday and pleaded guilty to two cyber hacking offenses, which carry a sentence of up to 10 years in prison.


According to investigating officer Detective Constable Anthony Jones, Georgeson said that he accessed the school’s system because he was bored and then started to wipe data.


When he realized that his actions could be traced and risks getting caught, Georgeson turned to more malicious actions.



“There was a great deal of resentment towards both his former employers - but that’s no excuse for his actions which caused significant problems for both and could’ve had more damaging consequences” - [Detective Constable Anthony Jones](https://www.leics.police.uk/news/leicestershire/news/2021/october/man-admits-breaking-into-computer-systems-of-previous-employers/)



Georgeson is scheduled to receive his sentence next year, on January 27.
