Microsoft today announced that Windows 11 is getting more stable and closer to release, with the latest Insider build being promoted to the Beta Channel.


As revealed by the company, the Windows 11 Insider Preview Build 22000.100 has started rolling out to Insiders in the Beta Channel.


"If you are in the Dev Channel, now would be the right time to consider switching to the Beta Channel if you want to stay on more stabilized builds of Windows 11," the Windows Insider team [said](https://blogs.windows.com/windows-insider/2021/07/22/announcing-windows-11-insider-preview-build-22000-100/).


"For those of you new to the Windows Insider Program and flighting of OS updates – check out [this article](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-insider/flighting) for how flighting works."


Among the things to expect, Windows 11 comes with an entirely new user interface, a new Start Menu, an improved File Explorer, Windows widgets, redesigned virtual desktops, and many more.

Upgrading to Windows 11
-----------------------


Even though Windows 11 will only start rolling out worldwide in early 2022, Microsoft already made it available to customers after officially unveiling it [as the next version of Windows](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/microsoft/microsoft-announces-windows-11-here-is-what-you-need-to-know/) in late June 2021.


Windows 11 is now available to all users [enrolled in the Windows Insider program](http://insider.windows.com/en-us/) and can be installed on any Windows 10 computer.


As part of the June launch, Microsoft also revealed the [Windows 11 hardware requirements](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/microsoft/microsoft-publishes-the-windows-11-system-requirements/), saying that a [TPM 2.0 security processor is required](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/microsoft/windows-11-wont-work-without-a-tpm-what-you-need-to-know/) to upgrade or install Windows 11.


However, as Microsoft later added, Windows Insiders already in the Dev channel [could still install Windows 11 preview builds](https://blogs.windows.com/windows-insider/2021/06/24/preparing-for-insider-preview-builds-of-windows-11/) even if not meeting the TPM CPU requirement.


After [enrolling in the Windows Insider program](http://insider.windows.com/en-us/), you can upgrade to the latest Windows 11 Insider build now rolling out worldwide by going into *Settings* > *Update & Security* > *Windows Insider Program* and activating the *Beta Channel* to get the Windows update.
