This week has quite a bit of news ranging from the USA formally accusing China of the recent ProxyLogon vulnerability and Kaseya mysteriously obtaining the universal decryption key.


The US government this week officially [attributed the ProxyLogon Microsoft Exchange attacks to China](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/us-and-allies-officially-accuse-china-of-microsoft-exchange-attacks/). Threat actors used this vulnerability to install a variety of malware, including the [BlackKingdom ransomware](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/microsoft-exchange-servers-now-targeted-by-black-kingdom-ransomware/).


In a surprise announcement, Kaseya has stated that they [received the universal decryption key](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/kaseya-obtains-universal-decryptor-for-revil-ransomware-victims/) for their July 2nd REvil ransomware attack. This key will allow all victims of the attack to recover their files for free.


It is unclear how they received this key yesterday as [REvil disappeared](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/revil-ransomware-gangs-web-sites-mysteriously-shut-down/) approximately two weeks ago. It is believed that the key was obtained by the Russian government, who shared it with the USA.


Other news this week includes an [attack on Ecaudor's CNT](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/ecuadors-state-run-cnt-telco-hit-by-ransomexx-ransomware/), CNA's attack was [caused by a fake browser update](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/ransomware-gang-breached-cna-s-network-via-fake-browser-update/), and that [HelloKitty is using a SonicWall vulnerability](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/hellokitty-ransomware-is-targeting-vulnerable-sonicwall-devices/) to breach networks.
