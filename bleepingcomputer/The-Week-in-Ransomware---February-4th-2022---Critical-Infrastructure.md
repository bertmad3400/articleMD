Critical infrastructure suffered ransomware attacks, with threat actors targeting an oil petrol distributor and oil terminals in major ports in different attacks.


Earlier this week, German petrol distributor [Oiltanking suffered a ransomware attack](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/german-petrol-supply-firm-oiltanking-paralyzed-by-cyber-attack/) allegedly by the new ALPHV/BlackCat ransomware operation.


Soon after, oil terminals in major ports disclosed that they too [suffered ransomware attacks](https://news.yahoo.com/european-oil-port-terminals-hit-130114768.html). However, officials [do not believe the attacks are linked](http://therecord.media/string-of-cyberattacks-on-european-oil-and-chemical-sectors-likely-not-coordinated-officials-say/).


If critical infrastructure was not bad enough, the Conti ransomware gang [attacked British snacks giant KP Snacks](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/kp-snacks-giant-hit-by-conti-ransomware-deliveries-disrupted/), causing disruptions in the supply chain.


The UK's HHS released a summary of the findings from the attack on Ireland's HSE and said that [80% of the IT systems were encrypted](http://HHS:%20Conti%20ransomware%20encrypted%2080%%20of%20Ireland's%20HSE%20IT%20systems) during the attack.


Finally, RecordedFuture conducted an [interview with the ALPHV ransomware gang](http://therecord.media/an-alphv-blackcat-representative-discusses-the-groups-plans-for-a-ransomware-meta-universe/), which provides some interesting insights into their new operation.
