Windows 10 comes with built-in personalization settings to help you customize the desktop and it provides plenty of options by default. However, if you want to get the most out of your desktop, we recommend these third-party open-source programs.


Fluent Search
-------------


Fluent Search is an open-source app that lets you search for running apps/processes, browser tabs, bookmarks, files, and more. Unlike Windows Search, Fluent Search offers accurate results and it lets you jump easily between running apps and browser tabs.

Fluent Search can also search for any open windows and it can even attempt to locate app-specific content inside them, such as buttons, hyperlinks, and more. Unlike Windows Search, search tags can filter search results easily. In addition to these features, Fluent Search also advanced Machine Learning models to learn your usage patterns and suggest results.


You can download Fluent Search from [Microsoft Store](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/blast-search/9nk1hlwhnp8s).


Modern Flyout
-------------


Modern Flyout is an open-source project that will replace Windows 10 or Windows 11's audio, aeroplane, and brightness flyouts with a customizable flyout with a modern UI.

Windows Terminal
----------------


Windows Terminal is another open-source software developed by Microsoft and it can help users launch multiple shell/console tabs in the same operating system.


Using Windows Terminal, you can replace PowerShell or Command Prompt instances. [Windows Terminal](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/microsoft/windows-terminal-is-here-in-its-multi-tabbed-console-glory/) can have a tab with a PowerShell console, another with the Windows 10 command prompt, and another with a WSL Ubuntu shell.
