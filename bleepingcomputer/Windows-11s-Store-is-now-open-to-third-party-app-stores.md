Microsoft is relaxing its app store policies for Windows and the redesigned marketplace will meet the needs of customers and developers across a variety of app experiences.


With Windows 11, Microsoft has opened up its store to developers using different types of frameworks, packaging technologies, and commerce platforms. Ahead of Windows 11's October 5 rollout, Microsoft has confirmed that its new app store will also support third-party app stores like Amazon AppStore and Epic Store.


"Today, we are sharing that Amazon and Epic Games will bring their storefront apps to the Microsoft Store over the next few months, and we look forward to welcoming other stores as well in the future," Microsoft [said](https://blogs.windows.com/windowsdeveloper/2021/09/28/microsoft-store-more-apps-more-open/).


Presumably, you'll be able to explore Epic Games and Amazon Android store's content in the Microsoft Store, but you'll need to create an account for Epic or Amazon to download their apps/games.


For example, if you want to download Android apps from Amazon Store, you'll need to download Amazon Store from the Microsoft Store and login using your Amazon ID. For those unaware, Windows 11's Android apps integration will be powered by Windows Subsystem for Android, which will be maintained via Microsoft Store and Windows Updates.

With Windows 11's new business model, Microsoft also wants to make sure the business terms are fair and help promote innovation. As a result, developers can also manage their own in-app payment method and avoid sharing revenue with Microsoft.


This is part of the company's "open Store for an open platform" approach, Microsoft said.


Additionally, Microsoft has confirmed that apps like Opera browser and Discord are now available in Store.
