Microsoft released Windows Terminal Preview v1.11 yesterday, and comes numerous improvements and features, including the ability to open a Terminal window by dropping a folder on the new tab button.


Windows Terminal is one of my favorite features to come to Windows 10 over the past few years as it provides a multi-tabbed console window that you can use for PowerShell, WSL, and Command Prompt consoles.


When using Windows Terminal, you can open multiple console tabs simultaneously with a mix of different shells, depending on your needs and the applications installed.


Windows Terminal is now a built-in application in Windows 10 and can be added as the default console program when right-clicking on a folder.


Even better, [Windows Terminal](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/windows-terminal-preview/9n8g5rfz9xk3?rtc=1&activetab=pivot:overviewtab) is [open source](https://github.com/microsoft/terminal/), allowing developers outside of Microsoft to contribute new features and fixes.


Windows Terminal Preview v1.11
------------------------------


Windows Terminal Preview v1.11 includes many fixes, but for us, one stands out - the new ability to drag and drop a folder on the new tab button to open a console directly to that folder.

This feature is still a little buggy as if you have increased text scaling in Windows 10, the hot spot to drop a folder will not be directly over the new tab button.


Other highlighted changes in this release are listed below:


* You can now delete autogenerated profiles.
* Terminal will now optionally present a tray icon and minimize windows to it.
* You can now set special font features and custom axis values!
* Bold or "intense" text can now be displayed as bright colors, a bold font, or both.
* There is a new "Split Tab" item in each tab's context menu, which will split the active profile.
* Terminal now supports displaying the titlebar¹ or tab row with the acrylic material.
* There's a new "unfocused appearance" editor at the bottom of the Appearance page (per profile).
* Key bindings now support the browser keys found on some keyboards newer than, say, 2000?
* You can now open a new tab by dropping a folder on the + button.
* Those of you with international keyboards can now specify very particular key bindings to "virtual key" codes or scancodes.
* On newer versions of Windows, startingDirectory can now accept Linux paths when launching a WSL profile.
* Tabs created with wt and default terminal instances will now have the launched command line as their title, instead of the default profile name.
* You can now navigate through panes in creation order using `nextPane` and `previousPane`.
* Navigating through panes with the move-focus action works much better and now also works correctly on startup.
* The toggleSplitOrientation action has been added and it switches a pair of panes from a vertical to a horizontal layout.
* The taskbar will now show the progress state of all of the panes/tabs combined, regardless of which is in focus. This is helpful if you’re running a build in an unfocused tab, for example.
* You can now use sc() and vk() for binding keys, which allows many more keys to be bindable.
