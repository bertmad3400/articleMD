This week's big news is the [arrests of two ransomware operators](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/ransomware-operators-behind-hundreds-of-attacks-arrested-in-ukraine/) in Ukraine responsible for hundreds of attacks targeting organizations worldwide.


The US is also proposing new bills and initiatives to force companies to disclose ransom payments and government contractors to disclose breaches.


Under the new Civil Cyber-Fraud Initiative, the US DOJ will [allow government contractors to be sued](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/us-govt-to-sue-contractors-who-hide-breach-incidents/) if they don't report a breach or fail to meet required cybersecurity standards.


A new '[Ransom Disclosure Act'](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/legal/ransom-disclosure-act-would-give-victims-48-hours-to-report-payments/) bill has been introduced to require any ransomware victims to report ransom payments within 48 hours.


Finally, some of the ransomware attacks revealed this week include [SandHills Global](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/sandhills-online-machinery-markets-shut-down-by-ransomware-attack/), [Weir Group](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/engineering-giant-weir-group-hit-by-ransomware-attack/), and we finally have confirmation that [Cox Media Group was attacked](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/cox-media-group-confirms-ransomware-attack-that-took-down-broadcasts/) in June.
