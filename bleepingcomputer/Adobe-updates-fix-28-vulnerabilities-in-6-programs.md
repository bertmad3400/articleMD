In total, Adobe fixed 28 vulnerabilities with today's updates.

Install updates immediately
---------------------------


While there were no known actively exploited zero-day vulnerabilities, Adobe advises customers to update to the latest versions as soon as possible.


This urgency is because threat actors can compare older versions of the software with the patched versions to determine what code is vulnerable and create exploits to target these vulnerabilities.


In most cases, users can update their software by using the auto-update feature of the product using the following steps:


* By going to **Help** > **Check for Updates**.
* The full update installers can be downloaded from Adobe's Download Center.
* Let the products update automatically, without requiring user intervention, when updates are detected.


If the new update is not available via autoupdate, you can check the security bulletins linked above for the latest download links.
