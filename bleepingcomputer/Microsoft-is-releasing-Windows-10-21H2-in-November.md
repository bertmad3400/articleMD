Microsoft is preparing Windows 10 21H2, the next Windows 10 version, for a November 2021 release and is now rolling it out to all Windows Insiders in the Release Preview Channel.


The Windows 10 21H2 feature update is offered as an optional update through the "seeker" experience in Windows Update to Insiders who go to Settings > Update & Security > Windows Update.


"We are preparing the Windows 10 November 2021 Update (Windows 10, version 21H2) for release," said Brandon LeBlanc, Senior Program Manager on the Windows Insider Program Team.


"We believe that Build 19044.1288 is the final build for the November 2021 Update, and the ISO for this build [can be downloaded here](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windowsinsiderpreviewiso).


"Once an Insider updates their PC to Windows 10, version 21H2, they will continue to automatically receive new servicing updates through Windows Update (the typical monthly update process)."

"Windows 10, version 21H2 will have a scoped set of features focused on productivity and security, prioritized to meet our customers' needs based on feedback," Microsoft's John Cable, Vice President, Program Management, Windows Servicing, and Delivery [explained](http://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/2021/07/15/introducing-the-next-feature-update-to-windows-10-21h2/) in July.


According to Cable, Windows 10 21H2 will add the following features:


* WPA3 H2E standards support for enhanced Wi-Fi security
* Windows Hello for Business introduces a new deployment method called cloud trust to support simplified passwordless deployments and achieve a deploy-to-run state within a few minutes
* GPU compute support in the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) and Azure IoT Edge for Linux on Windows (EFLOW) deployments for machine learning and other compute intensive workflows


However, today, LeBlanc said that Microsoft is still finalizing the Windows Hello for Business cloud trust deployment method and will be launched later with a monthly update.


"We will continue to improve the overall experience of the November 2021 Update on customers' PCs through our usual servicing cadence," he added.


Windows 10 21H2 will receive 18 months of support for Home and Pro editions and 30 months for Enterprise and Education editions.
