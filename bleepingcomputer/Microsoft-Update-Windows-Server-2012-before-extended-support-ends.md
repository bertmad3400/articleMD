Microsoft has reminded Windows Server 2012 and SQL Server 2012 users that the products will reach their extended support end dates during the next two years, urging them to update to avoid security and compliance gaps.


According to Microsoft, Windows Server 2012 and 2012 R2 Extended Support will end on October 10, 2023, while SQL Server 2012 Extended Support will end on July 12, 2022.



Even though Windows Server 2012 has reached its mainstream support end date in September 2018, the end date for extended support was pushed back five years for this exact reason: to allow organizations to migrate to newer, under-support Windows Server versions.


"We understand that SQL Server and Windows Server run many business-critical applications that may take more time to modernize," Microsoft [said](https://cloudblogs.microsoft.com/sqlserver/2021/07/14/know-your-options-for-sql-server-2012-and-windows-server-2012-end-of-support/).


"Customers that need to remain on-premises for compliance can protect their workloads by upgrading to SQL Server 2019 and Windows Server 2019.


"Customers that cannot meet the end of support deadline and have Software Assurance or subscription licenses under an enterprise agreement enrollment will have the option to buy Extended Security Updates to get three more years of security updates for SQL Server 2012, and Windows Server 2012 and 2012 R2."


Extended Security Updates pricing
---------------------------------


Regarding the price for Windows Server and SQL Server 2012 Extended Security Updates, Microsoft says that they will only cost for on-premises deployments:


* *In Azure:* Customers running SQL Server 2012 and Windows Server 2012 and 2012 R2 in Azure will get Extended Security Updates for free.
* *On-premises:* Customers with active Software Assurance or subscription licenses can purchase Extended Security Updates annually for 75 percent of the license cost of the latest version of SQL Server or Windows Server for the first year, 100 percent of the license cost for the second year, and 125 percent of the license cost for the third year.


The company says Windows Server and SQL Server 2012 Extended Security Updates will be made available for purchase later when getting closer to the end of extended support.


Additional information is available on the [Extended Security Updates frequently asked questions](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/extended-security-updates) page.


"With cyberattacks becoming more sophisticated and frequent, running apps and data on unsupported versions can create significant security and compliance risks," Microsoft [added](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-US/lifecycle/announcements/sql-server-2012-windows-server-2012-end-of-support).


"It is highly recommended that customers upgrade to the most current versions for better performance, efficiency, and regular security updates."
