The U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) is warning that hackers are exploiting a critical vulnerability in Zoho’s ManageEngine ADSelfService Plus password management solution that allows them to take control of the system.


ADSelfService Plus is aimed at larger organizations that need an integrated self-service password management for and single sign-on solution for Active Directory and cloud apps.


### Exploits detected in the wild


The security issue is identified as [CVE-2021-40539](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-40539). It is considered critical as it can allow a remote, unauthenticated attacker to execute arbitrary code on a vulnerable system.


Zoho has published a security advisory to announce that an update that patches the bug is currently available for ADSelfService Plus.


In a [security notification](https://www.manageengine.com/products/self-service-password/kb/how-to-fix-authentication-bypass-vulnerability-in-REST-API.html) week, the company says that it is “noticing indications of this vulnerability being exploited” in the wild.


The [alert from CISA](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ncas/current-activity/2021/09/07/zoho-releases-security-update-adselfservice-plus) is clear about this, though, as the agency informs that “CVE-2021-40539 has been detected in exploits in the wild.”


At this moment, information about the vulnerability is scarce. A severity score has not been calculated by the National Institute of Standards and Technology in the U.S. but Zoho notes that the issue is critical:


“An authentication bypass vulnerability affecting REST API URLs, that could result in remote code execution,” the company says.


Organizations with ADSelfService Plus builds lower than 6114 are urged to apply the latest update from the developer, available using the [service pack](https://www.manageengine.com/products/self-service-password/service-pack.html).


CVE-2021-40539 is the fifth critical vulnerability reported for Zoho ManageEngine ADSelfService Plus this year:
