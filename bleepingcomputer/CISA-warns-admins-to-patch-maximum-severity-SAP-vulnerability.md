The US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) has [warned admins](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ncas/current-activity/2022/02/08/critical-vulnerabilities-affecting-sap-applications-employing) to patch a set of severe security flaws dubbed ICMAD (Internet Communication Manager Advanced Desync) and impacting SAP business apps using Internet Communication Manager (ICM).


CISA added that failing to patch these vulnerabilities exposes organizations with vulnerable servers to data theft, financial fraud risks, disruptions of mission-critical business processes, ransomware attacks, and a halt of all operations.


ICMAD bugs affect most SAP products
-----------------------------------


Yesterday, Onapsis Research Labs who found and reported CVE-2022-22536, one of the three ICMAD bugs and the one rated as a maximum severity issue, also cautioned SAP customers to patch them immediately (the other two are tracked as CVE-2022-22532, and CVE-2022-22533).


The SAP Product Security Response Team (PSRT) worked with Onapsis to [create security patches to address these vulnerabilities](https://wiki.scn.sap.com/wiki/display/PSR/SAP+Security+Patch+Day+-+February+2022) and [released them on February 8](http://wiki.scn.sap.com/wiki/display/PSR/SAP+Security+Patch+Day+-+February+2022), during this month's Patch Tuesday.


If successfully exploited, the ICMAD bugs allow attackers to target SAP users, business information, and processes, and steal credentials, trigger denials of service, execute code remotely and, ultimately, fully compromise any unpatched SAP applications.


"The ICM is one of the most important components of an SAP NetWeaver application server: It is present in most SAP products and is a critical part of the overall SAP technology stack, connecting SAP applications with the Internet," Onapsis [explained](https://onapsis.com/icmad-sap-cybersecurity-vulnerabilities).


"Malicious actors can easily leverage the most critical vulnerability (CVSSv3 10.0) in unprotected systems; the exploit is simple, requires no previous authentication, no preconditions are necessary, and the payload can be sent through HTTP(S), the most widely used network service to access SAP applications."


No SAP customers breached using ICMAD exploits so far
-----------------------------------------------------


SAP's Director of Security Response Vic Chung [said](https://blogs.sap.com/2022/02/08/sap-partners-with-onapsis-to-identify-and-patch-cybersecurity-vulnerabilities/) they're currently not aware of any customers' networks breached using exploits targeting these vulnerabilities and "strongly" advised all impacted organizations to immediately apply patches "as soon as possible."


SAP customers can use [this open-source tool](http://github.com/Onapsis/onapsis_icmad_scanner) developed by Onapsis security researchers to help scan systems for ICMAD vulnerabilities.


The German business software developer also [patched other maximum severity vulnerabilities](https://wiki.scn.sap.com/wiki/display/PSR/SAP+Security+Patch+Day+-+February+2022) associated with the Apache Log4j 2 component used in SAP Commerce, SAP Data Intelligence 3 (on-premise), SAP Dynamic Authorization Management, Internet of Things Edge Platform, SAP Customer Checkout.


All of them allow remote threat actors to execute code on systems running unpatched software following successful exploitation.
