If there is one thing we learned this week, it's that not only are corporations vulnerable to insider threats but so are ransomware operations.


The LockBit 2.0 ransomware is now trying to [recruit corporate insiders](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/lockbit-ransomware-recruiting-insiders-to-breach-corporate-networks/) to help them breach networks. In return, the insider is promised millions of dollars.


On the flip side, ransomware operations are vulnerable too.


Yesterday, after being banned from the Conti ransomware operation, a [Conti affiliate leaked the training material](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/angry-conti-ransomware-affiliate-leaks-gangs-attack-playbook/) for the ransomware operation on the XSS hacking forum, giving security researchers and defenders an inside look at the tools being used by the group.


This week's other hot topic is the [rise of a new ransomware operation called BlackMatter](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/blackmatter-ransomware-gang-rises-from-the-ashes-of-darkside-revil/), which is believed to be a [rebrand of the DarkSide ransomware](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/darkside-ransomware-gang-returns-as-new-blackmatter-operation/) operation.


Finally, this week, we have had large ransomware attacks against [Italy's Lazio region](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/ransomware-attack-hits-italys-lazio-region-affects-covid-19-site/), [energy group ERG](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/energy-group-erg-reports-minor-disruptions-after-ransomware-attack/), and leading motherboard maker [Gigabyte](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/computer-hardware-giant-gigabyte-hit-by-ransomexx-ransomware/).

Since 2018, threat actors known as “Pysa” (for “Protect Your System Amigo”) have used mespinoza ransomware to lock up victims’ files after exfiltrating a copy of them. In early 2020, alerts about these “big-game hunters” were published by both the [FBI](https://www.ic3.gov/Media/News/2021/210316.pdf) and [CNIL](https://www.ic3.gov/Media/News/2021/210316.pdf) . Since then, Pysa has continued to pose a threat to the medical and education sectors. Like a number of other ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) groups, Pysa maintains a dedicated leak site on the dark web where they list victims who do not pay their ransom demands and then dump their data. They call them “partners.”

By the end of July, a new player called BlackMatter had entered the ransomware market. Is BlackMatter really new on the scene, however?
