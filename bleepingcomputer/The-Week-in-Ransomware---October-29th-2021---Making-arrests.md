This week, international law enforcement operations went on the offensive, making arrests in numerous countries for ransomware-related activities.


Today, Europol announced that [twelve individuals were arrested today](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/police-arrest-hackers-behind-over-1-800-ransomware-attacks/) for their links to over 1,800 ransomware attacks in 71 countries.


The arrested hackers include affiliates and penetration testers for the LockerGoga, MegaCortex, and Dharma operations, including those suspected to be behind the 2019 [attack against Norsk Hydro](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/lockergoga-ransomware-sends-norsk-hydro-into-manual-mode/).


German law enforcement is also believed to have [identified a core member of the REvil ransomware gang](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/german-investigators-identify-revil-ransomware-gang-core-member/).


The other big news this week is the revealment of a [BlackMatter decryptor created by Emsisoft](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/blackmatter-ransomware-victims-quietly-helped-using-secret-decryptor/) that has been secretly used to help victims recover their files without paying a ransom.


Avast also released two decryptors this week - one for [Babuk Ransomware](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/babuk-ransomware-decryptor-released-to-recover-files-for-free/) and another that [decrypts files encrypted by Atom Silo and LockFile files](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/free-decryptor-released-for-atom-silo-and-lockfile-ransomware/).


Finally, the [NRA suffered a ransomware attack](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/nra-no-comment-on-russian-ransomware-gang-attack-claims/) by the Grief ransomware operation, which is linked to the US sanctioned Evil Corp hacking group.


Today, the Grief gang [removed their NRA from their data leak site](https://twitter.com/BrettCallow/status/1454085960912629764), indicating that the NRA may have paid the ransom demand.
