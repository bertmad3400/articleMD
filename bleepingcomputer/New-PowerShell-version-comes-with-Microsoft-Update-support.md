Microsoft has released PowerShell 7.2 with automatic updates through the Microsoft Update service on Windows 10 and Windows Server devices.


"We have integration with Microsoft Update to automatically keep your installation of 7.2 updated whenever we have a servicing release which only includes critical bug fixes or security updates," [said](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/powershell/general-availability-of-powershell-7-2/) Steve Lee, Principal Software Engineer Manager for PowerShell.


"The MSI installer will automatically enable updating PowerShell 7 as well as enabling Microsoft Update."


With Microsoft Update, you will get the latest updates through your usual Windows Update management flow via Windows Update for Business, WSUS, SCCM, or the Settings dialog.


Users will also be able to opt-out of automatic updates if they would instead update PowerShell manually.


Support for stable and preview channels
---------------------------------------


Microsoft Update can deliver both preview and stable versions on systems where they're used side-by-side, upgrading to the newest release available on the preview and stable channels.


"You would need to install 7.2 GA separately to have Microsoft Update enabled for our stable channel where you would be updated to 7.2.1 should we have a servicing release and eventually to 7.3 GA," Lee added.


Redmond first announced that it would release future PowerShell updates via Windows Update [in June](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/microsoft/microsoft-will-release-future-powershell-updates-via-windows-update/).


[PowerShell](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/overview?view=powershell-7.1) provides a scripting language focused on automation, a command-line shell, and a framework for processing PowerShell cmdlets.


It's a cross-platform product compatible with all major operating systems, including Windows, Linux, and macOS. It allows working with structured data such as JSON, CSV, XML, REST APIs, and object models.


Other update highlights for PowerShell 7.2:
-------------------------------------------


* New universal installer packages for most supported Linux distributions
* Two new experimental features
	+ Improved native command argument passing support
	+ ANSI FileInfo color support
* Improved Tab Completions
* PSReadLine 2.1 with Predictive IntelliSense
* Seven experimental features promoted to mainstream and 1 removed
* Separating DSC from PowerShell 7 to enable future improvements
* Several breaking changes to improve usability
