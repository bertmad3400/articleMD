Microsoft has released Windows 11 and Windows 10, version 21H2 feature updates for enterprise testing before their general release later this year.


"Organizations enrolled in the Windows Insider Program for Business can access these builds through all standard channels, including Windows Update, Windows Server Update Services (WSUS), Azure Marketplace, and the Windows Insider Program ISO download page," Microsoft said.


"Along with commercial pre-release availability, we are also offering free support for commercial organizations running these builds. 


For Windows Update or Windows Update for Business users, the Windows 11 commercial preview can be accessed by enterprise customers on devices that meet the [hardware requirements](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/whats-new/windows-11-requirements) with the [KB5005101 optional cumulative update](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/microsoft/windows-10-kb5005101-cumulative-update-released-with-34-fixes/) released on September 1.


Those who don't want to upgrade to Windows 11 immediately can choose the "Stay on Windows 10 for now" option and install the Windows 10 21H2 feature update.


Commercial devices in the Release Preview Insider Channel which don't meet the Windows 11 hardware requirements will be offered Windows 10 21H2 automatically instead.


According to Microsoft, a device is considered a commercial device if it's not running Windows 10 Home, is managed by an IT admin, OR it has a volume license key or commercial ID or is joined to a Windows domain.

If you're using Windows Server Update Service (WSUS), you can access the two feature updates in the "Windows Insider Pre-release" category in WSUS and Microsoft Endpoint Manager (MEM) Configuration Manager.


The Windows 11 and Windows 10 21H2 commercial previews can also be accessed via the [Windows Insider Program ISO site](https://aka.ms/WIPISO) or the Azure Marketplace.
