At its Surface event, Microsoft today announced four new devices - Surface Duo 2, Surface Go 3, Surface Laptop Studio, and Surface Pro 8.


Surface Duo 2
-------------



Surface Duo 2 is based on the original Surface Duo, but this new model pushes the boundaries of what a mobile device could be. With Surface Duo 2, Microsoft is introducing a new camera and gaming experience, and editing controls for creators. It brings productivity and entertainment with you wherever you go, thanks to Microsoft Launcher's integration with other Microsoft services.


Surface Duo 2 comes with all features that you expect from a modern premium smartphone. It is powered by Snapdragon 888, 8.3″ PixelSense Fusion displays, a dynamic triple-lens camera, NFC for contactless payments and 5G connectivity.


"Surface Duo 2 is much more than a phone," Microsoft officials said during the event. As per the tech firm, Surface Duo 2 supports all popular Android apps like TikTok, Kindle and games. Microsoft is also working on new gaming experiences for games like Asphalt 9: Legends.


Surface Duo 2 starts at $1499.99 and is available for [pre-order today](https://www.microsoft.com/d/surface-duo-2/9408kgxp4xjl) in select markets.


Surface Go 3
------------



Surface Go 3 is the same Surface Go 2 from the last year, but it is now faster and better, thanks to the new Intel processors. Surface Go 3 is 60% faster with an Intel Core i3 processor and it can now run Windows 11. Additionally, Microsoft has added an optional LTE Advanced model to the lineup.


Surface Go 3 with WiFi starts at $399.99 and is available for pre-order today in select markets. 


Surface Laptop Studio
---------------------



Surface Laptop Studio is an ideal product for creators and designers. It is based on both Surface Book and Surface Laptop Studio, and it features a new ultra-durable Dynamic Woven Hinge, allowing users to switch between different modes:


* Laptop mode lets you enjoy a first-class typing experience.
* Stage mode brings the 14.4” PixelSense touchscreen forward for gaming, streaming, docking, or presenting to clients.
* Studio mode lets you draw and write on the display.


Surface Laptop Studio starts at $1599.99 and is available for [pre-order today](https://www.microsoft.com/d/surface-laptop-studio/8srdf62swkpf) in select markets.


Surface Pro 8
-------------



Surface Pro 8 looks a lot like Surface Pro X and it represents the most significant leap forward since Surface Pro 3, according to Panos Panay and the team. Surface Pro 8 uses 11th-gen processors, supports Thunderbolt 4 ports, and is more than twice as fast as Pro 7.


Thanks to Windows 11 and new processors, you can expect up to 16 hours of battery life, which makes the Surface Pro 8 the most powerful 2-in-1 on the market.


Surface Pro 8 comes with a vibrant 13” PixelSense touchscreen and 5MP front-facing camera. It also supports Dolby Atmos sound and Studio Mics.


Surface Pro 8 starts at $1099.99 and is available for [pre-order](https://www.microsoft.com/d/surface-pro-8/8qwcrtq8v8xg) in select markets.
