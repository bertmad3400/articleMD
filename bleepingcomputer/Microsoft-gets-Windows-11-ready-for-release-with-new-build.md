Microsoft has moved Windows 11 to the Windows Insider 'Release' channel in anticipation of its upcoming launch on October 5th.


Until today, the Windows Insider Release channel has been offering users Windows 10 21H2 (v19044), which is expected to be released next month.


Starting today, Microsoft is now offering Windows 11 as an optional download within Windows Update for users with [compatible hardware](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/microsoft/microsoft-publishes-the-windows-11-system-requirements/), as shown below.

The Windows 11 build offered in the Release channel is [Build 22000.194](https://blogs.windows.com/windows-insider/2021/09/16/announcing-windows-11-insider-preview-build-22000-194/), which was also released to users in the Beta channel on September 16th.


For the last couple of Windows 11 builds in the Beta channel, Microsoft has only been fixing bugs in preparation for the operating system's launch.


Unfortunately, there are still [numerous features missing from Windows 11](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/microsoft/windows-11-is-coming-soon-but-users-want-these-features-back/) that users have grown accustomed to in Windows 10 and are requesting to be added back to Windows 11.


These missing features include the Taskbar context menu, the ability to drag and drop files onto open Taskbar applications, the ability to move the taskbar to the top or sides of the screen, and the ability to ungroup running applications.


While Microsoft is aware of these requests, none of them are likely to make it into the initial release of Windows 111.


If these missing features are critical to you, it may be wise to wait for the next version of Windows 11 before installing the new operating system.
