It has been quite a busy week with ransomware, with law enforcement making arrests, data-wiping attacks, and the return of the Qlocker ransomware.


This week's biggest news is [Russia's arrest of fourteen suspected members of the REvil ransomware](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/russia-charges-8-suspected-revil-ransomware-gang-members/) operation. In addition, a senior Biden administration official said that one of the fourteen suspects is [responsible for the Colonial Pipeline ransomware attack](https://therecord.media/biden-official-one-of-arrested-russian-hackers-carried-out-the-colonial-pipeline-attack/).


Europol also conducted a [law enforcement operation against VPNLab](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/europol-shuts-down-vpn-service-used-by-ransomware-groups/), a platform commonly used by ransomware gangs. Law enforcement operatives seized 15 servers used by the VPNLab.net service and took down its main site, making the platform no longer available.


While it was a good week for law enforcement, sadly, new attacks were discovered.


Microsoft disclosed attacks on Ukrainian organizations using [data-wiping malware disguised as ransomware](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/microsoft-fake-ransomware-targets-ukraine-in-data-wiping-attacks/). This malware is named "WhisperGate," and has been attributed by Ukrainian officials as being conducted by, or at the behest, of the Russian government.


For consumers and small businesses, we saw the unfortunate [return of Qlocker](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/qlocker-ransomware-returns-to-target-qnap-nas-devices-worldwide/), notorious ransomware that encrypted thousands of QNAP NAS devices last year.


Finally, in research released by security companies we learned that [White Rabbit ransomware is linked to FIN8 hackers](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/new-white-rabbit-ransomware-linked-to-fin8-hacking-group/), new analysis of the [BlackCat/ArchV](https://www.sentinelone.com/labs/blackcat-ransomware-highly-configurable-rust-driven-raas-on-the-prowl-for-victims/) and [Avaddon](https://www.mandiant.com/resources/chasing-avaddon-ransomware) ransomware operations, and the [FBI linking Diavol to the TrickBot Group](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/fbi-links-diavol-ransomware-to-the-trickbot-cybercrime-group/).
