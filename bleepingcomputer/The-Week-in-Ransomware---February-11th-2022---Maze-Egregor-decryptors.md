We saw the Maze ransomware developers reemerge briefly this week as they shared the master decryption keys for the Egregor, Maze, and Sekhmet ransomware operations.


After the [Maze ransomware operation began shutting down](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/maze-ransomware-is-shutting-down-its-cybercrime-operation/) in October 2020, it always hoped that they would publicly release the decryptions to allow remaining victims to recover their files.


Tuesday night, almost fourteen months later, the alleged ransomware developer [released the decryption keys](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/ransomware-dev-releases-egregor-maze-master-decryption-keys/) in a BleepingComputer forum post.


While the developer says they had always planned to publish the keys, it is generally believed that they did it now as a gesture of goodwill due to the recent arrests and server seizures.


Using these keys, cybersecurity firm Emsisoft created [a decryptor](https://www.emsisoft.com/ransomware-decryption-tools/maze-sekhmet-egregor) allowing victims to recover their files for free.


The other big news is the [sentencing of a Netwalker ransomware affiliate from Canada](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/netwalker-ransomware-affiliate-sentenced-to-80-months-in-prison/), who obtained more than $27.6 million by attacking companies worldwide. After pleading guilty, the affiliate was sentenced to 6 years and eight months in prison.


This week's other interesting ransomware news includes publishing [LockBit 2.0 ransomware technical details](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/fbi-shares-lockbit-ransomware-technical-details-defense-tips/) by the FBI, a free [decryptor for the TargetCompany](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/free-decryptor-released-for-targetcompany-ransomware-victims/) ransomware, and [Puma announcing a data breach](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/puma-hit-by-data-breach-after-kronos-ransomware-attack/) due to the Kronos ransomware attack.

In 2021, cybersecurity authorities in the United States,[[1](https://www.fbi.gov/investigate/cyber)][[2](https://www.cisa.gov/)][[3](https://www.nsa.gov/Cybersecurity/)] Australia,[[4](https://www.cyber.gov.au/)] and the United Kingdom[[5](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/)] observed an increase in sophisticated, high-impact ransomware incidents against critical infrastructure organizations globally. The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), and the National Security Agency (NSA) observed incidents involving ransomware against 14 of [the 16 U.S. critical infrastructure sectors](https://www.cisa.gov/critical-infrastructure-sectors), including the Defense Industrial Base, Emergency Services, Food and Agriculture, Government Facilities, and Information Technology Sectors. The Australian Cyber Security Centre (ACSC) observed continued ransomware targeting of Australian critical infrastructure entities, including in the Healthcare and Medical, Financial Services and Markets, Higher Education and Research, and Energy Sectors. The United Kingdom’s National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC-UK) recognizes ransomware as the biggest cyber threat facing the United Kingdom. Education is one of the top UK sectors targeted by ransomware actors, but the NCSC-UK has also seen attacks targeting businesses, charities, the legal profession, and public services in the Local Government and Health Sectors.
