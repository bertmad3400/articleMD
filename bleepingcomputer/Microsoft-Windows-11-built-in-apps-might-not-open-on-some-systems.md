Microsoft says Windows 11 users might experience issues opening or using some built-in apps and features due to an expired digital certificate.


"Starting on November 1, 2021, some users might be unable to open or use certain built-in Windows apps or parts of some built-in apps that have not installed KB5006746, released October 21, 2021," Microsoft explained on the Windows health dashboard.


"This is caused by an issue with a Microsoft digital certificate, which expired October 31, 2021. Devices running in S mode are more likely to be affected."


The complete list of apps and features potentially impacted by this Windows 11, version 21H2 known issue includes:


* Snipping Tool
* Accounts page and landing page in the Settings app (S mode only)
* Touch Keyboard, Voice Typing, and Emoji Panel
* Input Method Editor user interface (IME UI)
* Getting started and Tips


Redmond [says](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/release-health/status-windows-11-21h2#2737msgdesc) affected Windows 11 customers can install the [KB5006746 release preview update](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/microsoft/windows-11-kb5006746-update-fixes-gaming-performance-issues/) to resolve issues impacting the Touch Keyboard, the Voice Typing and Emoji Panel, the Input Method Editor user interface (IME UI), and the Getting Started and Tips feature.


The company is currently working on a fix to address this new known issue which will be provided with a future update.

Microsoft also said on Friday that Windows customers are experiencing problems with network printing after installing the Windows 11 [KB5006674](https://support.microsoft.com/help/5006674) and Windows 10 [KB5006670](https://support.microsoft.com/help/5006670) October Patch Tuesday updates.


As Redmond explained, customers attempting to connect to printers shared on Windows print servers may encounter errors — i.e., 0x000006e4(RPC\_S\_CANNOT\_SUPPORT), 0x0000007c(ERROR\_INVALID\_LEVEL), 0x00000709(ERROR\_INVALID\_PRINTER\_NAME) — preventing them from printing over the network.
