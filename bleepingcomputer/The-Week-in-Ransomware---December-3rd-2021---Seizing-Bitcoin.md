For this week's 'Week in Ransomware' article we have included the latest ransomware news over the past two weeks.


The biggest news over the past two weeks is the unsealing of a United States' Complaint for Forfeiture detailing how the [FBI seized 39.89138522 bitcoins from an Exodus wallet](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/fbi-seized-23m-from-affiliate-of-revil-gandcrab-ransomware-gangs/) belonging to an REvil affiliate. Based on the email listed in the court document, it is believed that the affiliate is one known as 'Lalartu.'


We also learned that the BlackByte ransomware gang [exploits the Microsoft Exchange ProxyShell vulnerabilities](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/microsoft-exchange-servers-hacked-to-deploy-blackbyte-ransomware/) to gain initial access to internal networks. Therefore, make sure to update your servers.


The FBI also disclosed that Cuba ransomware has [attacked 49 US critical infrastructure orgs](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/fbi-cuba-ransomware-breached-49-us-critical-infrastructure-orgs/) and received at least US $43.9 million in ransom payments.


Finally, some of the attacks we learned about over the past two weeks include [Planned Parenthood Los Angeles](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/planned-parenthood-la-discloses-data-breach-after-ransomware-attack/), [Swire Pacific Offshore](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/marine-services-provider-swire-pacific-offshore-hit-by-ransomware/), and [Correos Express](https://www.lemagit.fr/actualites/252510274/Ransomware-lespagnol-Correos-apparait-aux-prises-avec-Hive).
