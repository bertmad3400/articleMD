Brother is warning that many of their printers may no longer work or display errors when using a USB connection in Windows 11.


One [help article](https://support.brother.com/g/b/faqend.aspx?c=as_ot&lang=en&prod=mfcj2330dw_eu_as_cn&faqid=faq00100757_000) states that updating to Windows 11 could prevent the operating system from detecting your Brother machine when connected via USB, changing printer settings, or connecting more than one printer via USB.


Brother states that there are 92 printer models affected by this behavior, which are listed below:


When printing, Brother also warns that users of 106 different printer models may receive an error from the "USB Connection Repair Tool," stating, "Cannot print to the USB printer."

However, Brother states that you can ignore the error, and the document should print successfully.


Finally, [Brother says](https://help.brother-usa.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/175628) that USB-connected printers will not be able to communicate with various printing utilities in Windows 11, including:


* Device Settings Tool
* Paper Size Setup Tool
* Distributed Print Tool
* Special ID Setting Tool
* Wireless Setup Wizard
* P-Touch Editor 5.4
* Update Software
* Transfer Manager
* Transfer Express
* Template Settings
* Printer Setting Tool


For users affected by any of these issues, Brother recommends temporarily using a different connection method, such as a wireless or wired network connection.


Brother states that they are investigating the issue and are working on a resolution.


While Microsoft has not acknowledged these printing issues, it would not be surprising if they placed a safeguard hold on computers with Brother devices that prevent them from being upgraded to Windows 11.


Microsoft is already [investigating eight other issues](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/microsoft/windows-11-microsoft-is-investigating-these-eight-problems/), including safeguard holds for networking software, Oracle VirtualBox, and the Cốc Cốc web browser.
