Microsoft has fixed a recently confirmed Windows 11 issue in a newly released build for Windows Insiders in the Beta and Release Preview channels.


This issue [would prevent apps from opening](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/microsoft/microsoft-windows-installer-breaks-apps-after-updates-repairs/) on multiple client and server Windows versions after being repaired or updated using the Windows Installer system tool (previously known as Microsoft Installer).


Systems affected by this bug include those where Windows users have installed the [KB5007215](https://support.microsoft.com/help/5007215) cumulative update issued during this month's Patch Tuesday.


The fix issued today with Windows 11 Build 22000.348 (KB5007262) only for Windows Insiders is also expected to roll out to all impacted Windows 11 customers during the December 2021 Patch Tuesday.


"We fixed a known issue that might prevent apps, such as Kaspersky apps, from opening after you attempt to repair or update the apps using the Microsoft Installer (MSI)," the Windows Insider Program Team [said](https://blogs.windows.com/windows-insider/2021/11/19/releasing-windows-11-build-22000-348-to-beta-and-release-preview-channels/).

--------------------------------------------------------


While Microsoft is now providing Windows Insiders running the latest Windows 11 beta build with a fix, users of all other Windows versions impacted by this issue will have to wait for a future update.

Workaround available
--------------------


While not all impacted Windows versions have a fix ready, Microsoft provides a workaround for customers experiencing difficulties launching apps after deploying one of the problematic updates.


"To mitigate this issue, you will need to uninstall the affected app, then install the latest version of the app," Microsoft said.


Redmond's engineers are working to address this issue for all other Windows customers, which will be released with a future update.


Microsoft is also readying an update to address another issue impacting Windows 11 customers that can trigger [blue screens of death (BSODs)](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/microsoft/windows-11-issue-with-intel-audio-drivers-triggers-blue-screens/) on systems with Intel Smart Sound Technology (SST) audio DSP drivers.
