Windows 11 is now available for devices with supported hardware features. If you've already upgraded to Windows 11 and you're looking for some great apps for your Windows 11 device, here's a list of easy-to-use open-source and free app.


RoundedTB
---------


Popular open-source tool RoundedTB, which enables rounded corners for the taskbar on Windows 10, has been updated with support for a new dynamic mode on Windows 11.

The dynamic mode automatically resizes the taskbar to create a docker like experience similar to macOS' Dock. It also comes with independent margin controls and better support for TranslucentTB, another open-source tool that enables transparency effect for the taskbar. 


For Windows 10 users, it comes with a split mode, a simplified version of dynamic mode for Windows 10.


If you're interested, you can download the app from [here](https://github.com/torchgm/RoundedTB/releases).


EarTrumpet
----------


Windows 11 uses the same old volume mixer from the Settings app, but you can expand the default functionality with a free tool called EarTrumpet. EarTrumpet replaces the default audio volume mixer in the OS completely and it's available for free in the Microsoft Store.


EarTrumpet features a modern user interface and it perfectly blends into Windows 11's new rounded corners experience.

As you can see in the above GIF, this app lets you adjust the volume level for each app and it replaces the existing volume mixer. The app doesn't come with any other interesting features, but it supports keyboard shortcuts.


You can download EarTrumpet from [here](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/store/p/eartrumpet/9nblggh516xp)


Files
-----


Created by a group of independent developers, Files is a free, open-source, modern, and universal file manager app for Windows.


Unlike File Explorer, Files comes with a modern interface and tabs and also supports Windows 11's Mica + Fluent Design.
