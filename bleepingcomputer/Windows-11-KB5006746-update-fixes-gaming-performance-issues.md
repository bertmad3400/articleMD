Microsoft has released the optional KB5006746 cumulative update preview for Windows 11, fixing sixty-four issues, including AMD CPU performance and gaming issues.


This cumulative update preview is part of Microsoft's scheduled October 2021 monthly "C" updates, allowing Windows 11 users to test the upcoming fixes being released on September 9th as part of Patch Tuesday.


Unlike the Patch Tuesday updates, schedule "C" updates are optional and only contain bug fixes and performance improvements but no security updates.


To install this update, you need to go to **Settings** > **Windows Update**and manually 'Check for updates.' As this is an optional update, Windows will not install it until you click on the 'Download now' button, as shown below.

Gaming performance issues fixed
-------------------------------


This update fixes numerous issues with gaming performance in Windows 11.


Since Windows 11's release, users have been complaining of [noticeable performance issues with AMD Ryzen CPUs](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/microsoft/amd-warns-of-up-to-15-percent-windows-11-performance-decrease/).


In a [support article](http://web.archive.org/web/20211006195809/https://www.amd.com/en/support/kb/faq/pa-400) published by AMD, it was explained that these issues are caused by "L3 cache latency may increase for some applications" and "UEFI CPPC2 ("preferred core") may not preferentially schedule threads on a processor's fastest core."


"Addresses an L3 caching issue that might affect performance in some applications on devices that have AMD Ryzen processors after upgrading to Windows 11 (original release)," explains the release notes for today's update.


With the KB5006746 update, Microsoft has also fixed an issue causing Bluetooth mice and keyboards to be slower than expected, which can adversely affect shooters and eSports games.
