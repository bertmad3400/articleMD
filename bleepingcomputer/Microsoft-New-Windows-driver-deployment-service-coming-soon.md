Microsoft said that the new Windows Update for Business deployment service for drivers and firmware will be available in Microsoft Endpoint Manager and Microsoft Graph as a public preview starting with the first half of 2022.


Once launched, it will enable enterprise admins to choose the drivers to deliver via Windows Update in their environment out of an assortment of matching options and schedule them for deployment.


Admins will be able to pick the right drivers by browsing the entire collection of drivers from independent hardware vendors (IHVs) and original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) available on Windows Update.


This prevents the entire Windows driver catalog from being offered to endpoint users, with only those that receive the admins' approval being delivered instead.


"Microsoft is excited to announce a new deployment service for driver and firmware updates, giving you visibility into the drivers hosted in Windows Update that are a match for your enterprise devices," the company [said](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/microsoft/microsoft-is-giving-windows-admins-full-control-over-driver-updates/) in March when it first announced the new service.

Microsoft added that enterprises would want to make sure that the right drivers and firmware are deployed in their environment because:


* The hardware ecosystem constantly publishes new drivers and fixes to Windows Update.
* The Windows Update service targets devices with the right drivers just for them.
* Security incidents are often mitigated via driver updates and require a quick servicing response.


Redmond will also provide management reporting for driver servicing capabilities when the new service reaches public preview.


The reports will be accessible as Workbooks via Microsoft's analytics product for Windows Update for Business: Update Compliance.


Reporting will be available for all approved updates and recommended updates that require attention, including drill-downs designed to reveal individual device impact.


The service's public preview for Microsoft Graph will kick off in January 2022 and the first half of 2022 for Intune.
