The US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) has added a new flaw to its catalog of vulnerabilities exploited in the wild, an Apple WebKit remote code execution bug used to target iPhones, iPads, and Macs.


According to the [binding operational directive (BOD 22-01)](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/cisa-orders-federal-agencies-to-fix-hundreds-of-exploited-security-flaws/) issued by CISA in November, federal agencies are now required to patch their systems against this actively exploited vulnerability impacting iOS, iPadOS, and macOS devices.


CISA said that all Federal Civilian Executive Branch Agencies (FCEB) agencies have to patch the vulnerability tracked as CVE-2022-22620 [[1](http://support.apple.com/en-us/HT213093), [2](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT213092)] until February 25th, 2022.


"These types of vulnerabilities are a frequent attack vector for malicious cyber actors of all types and pose significant risk to the federal enterprise," the cybersecurity agency [said](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ncas/current-activity/2022/02/11/cisa-adds-one-known-exploited-vulnerability-catalog).


"Although BOD 22-01 only applies to FCEB agencies, CISA strongly urges all organizations to reduce their exposure to cyberattacks by prioritizing timely remediation of Catalog vulnerabilities as part of their vulnerability management practice."


Yesterday, CISA also [asked FCEB agencies to patch 15 other vulnerabilities](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/cisa-urges-orgs-to-patch-actively-exploited-windows-serioussam-bug/) tagged as being under active exploitation, with [CVE-2021-36934](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/cve-2021-36934/) — a Microsoft Windows SAM (Security Accounts Manager) bug allowing privilege escalation and credential theft — having a February 24th patch deadline.


Third zero-day patched by Apple this year
-----------------------------------------


The CVE-2022-22620 is the third zero-day Apple has patched since the start of 2022 and is a WebKit [Use After Free](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/416.html) issue exploitable for OS crashes and code execution on vulnerable devices.


Successful exploitation enables attackers to execute arbitrary code on iPhones, iPads, and Macs after opening maliciously crafted web pages using Safari.


"In particular, all browsers for iOS and iPadOS are based on this open source engine — that is, not only iPhone’s default Safari, but also Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox and any others," [Kaspersky said](https://www.kaspersky.com/blog/webkit-vulnerability-cve-2022-22620/43650/) today. "So even if you do not use Safari, this vulnerability still affects you directly."


"Apple is aware of a report that this issue may have been actively exploited," the company added when describing the zero-day.


Apple has addressed the vulnerability with improved memory management in iOS 15.3.1, iPadOS 15.3.1, and macOS Monterey 12.2.1.


The complete list of impacted devices is quite extensive, and it includes iPhone 6s and later, multiple iPad models, and Macs running macOS Monterey.


Even though this flaw was likely only used in a small number of targeted attacks, it's still highly recommended to install the updates as soon as possible to block potential attack attempts, just as CISA urged earlier today.


In January, [Apple also patched two other actively exploited zero-days](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/apple/apple-fixes-new-zero-day-exploited-to-hack-macos-ios-devices/) that can let attackers track browsing activity and users' identities in real-time (CVE-2022-22594) and gain arbitrary code execution with kernel privileges (CVE-2022-22587).
