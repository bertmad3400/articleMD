Apple has announced a new free-of-charge service program for iPhone 12 and iPhone 12 Pro devices experiencing sound issues caused by a receiver module component.


According to the company, the sound problems impact a low percentage of iPhone 12 models that were made over six months between October 2020 and April 2021.


"Apple has determined that a very small percentage of iPhone 12 and iPhone 12 Pro devices may experience sound issues due to a component that might fail on the receiver module," the company [said in a new support document](https://support.apple.com/iphone-12-and-iphone-12-pro-service-program-for-no-sound-issues).


"Affected devices were manufactured between October 2020 and April 2021. If your iPhone 12 or iPhone 12 Pro does not emit sound from the receiver when you make or receive calls, it may be eligible for service."


Customers with iPhone 12 or iPhone 12 Pro exhibiting sound issues can request to have them serviced for free through:


* an [Apple Authorized Service Provider](https://getsupport.apple.com/?caller=erep&SG=SG003&category_id=SC0999&symptom_id=99934&solution=CIN),
* an [Apple Retail Store](https://getsupport.apple.com/?caller=erep&SG=SG003&category_id=SC0999&symptom_id=99934&solution=CIN),
* or the Apple Repair Center after arranging mail-in service through [Apple Support](https://getsupport.apple.com/?caller=erep&SG=SG003&category_id=SC0999&symptom_id=99934).


iPhone 12 mini and iPhone 12 Pro Max units not eligible
-------------------------------------------------------


Before asking to have their phones fixed, customers are advised to [back up their iPhone](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT203977) to iCloud or their computer. 


Apple also provides [detailed guidance on preparing iPhones](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201557) before taking them for service to an Apple Store, Apple Authorized Service Provider, or carrier.


According to Apple, the list of devices eligible for this new service program does not include iPhone 12 mini and iPhone 12 Pro Max models.


Additionally, this free-of-charge service program only covers impacted iPhone 12 or iPhone 12 Pro units two years after the first retail sale.


"If your iPhone 12 or iPhone 12 Pro has any damage which impairs the ability to complete the repair, such as a cracked screen, that issue will need to be resolved prior to the service," the company added. "In some cases, there may be a cost associated with the additional repair."


Last October, Apple launched another [service program to address AirPods Pro sound issues](https://support.apple.com/airpods-pro-service-program-sound-issues), including crackling or static sounds increasing in loud environments and faulty Active Noise Cancellation.
