This week, law enforcement struck a massive blow against the REvil ransomware operation, with multiple arrests announced and the seizure of cryptocurrency.


On Monday, the US Department of Justice, Europol, and Interpol announced [arrests of REvil affiliates and members](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/revil-ransomware-affiliates-arrested-in-romania-and-kuwait/) in Kuwait and Romania. The FBI also announced the arrest of the REvil affiliate behind the July Kaseya attack that encrypted over 1,500 organizations.


In addition, the US announced that [$6 million in ransom payments was seized](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/us-seizes-6-million-from-revil-ransomware-arrest-kaseya-hacker/) from the REvil ransomware operation.


After [REvil shut down in October](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/revil-ransomware-shuts-down-again-after-tor-sites-were-hijacked/), it was expected that the group would rebrand as a new operation shortly. However, with the recent news of the arrests and that the FBI hijacked their server, it is possible that they may call it quits as other cybercriminals will likely not want want to work with them again.


This week, the other big news is a massive [attack on the European electronics retailer MediaMarkt](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/electronics-retail-giant-mediamarkt-hit-by-ransomware-attack/) by the Hive Ransomware operation.


Other news this week is the [Clop gang using the Serv-U vulnerability](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/clop-gang-exploiting-solarwinds-serv-u-flaw-in-ransomware-attacks/) to breach networks and a new [US bill laying out ransomware response steps](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/new-bill-sets-ransomware-attack-response-rules-for-us-financial-orgs/) for financial organizations.
