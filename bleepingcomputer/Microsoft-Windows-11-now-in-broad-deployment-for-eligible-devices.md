Microsoft says Windows 11 has now entered the broad deployment phase, making it available for everyone with an eligible device via Windows Update.


This means that Windows 11 21H2, the latest release, will be offered to all Windows devices not affected by compatibility holds or configured to defer feature updates.


"The upgrade offer to Windows 11 is entering its final phase of availability and is designated for broad deployment for eligible devices," the company said in a Windows Health dashboard status update.


Microsoft also saw strong demand for Windows 11 since its release in October 2021, with customers upgrading their systems to Windows 11 at twice the rate seen with Windows 10. 


Windows 11 broad rollout starts earlier
---------------------------------------


Panos Panay, Microsoft's Chief Product Officer for Windows and Devices, added that Windows 11 has "the highest quality scores and product satisfaction" of any Windows version ever shipped. 


"Based on this trend, we are advancing the pace of the rollout faster than we originally announced and entering the final phase of availability for Windows 11 ahead of our initial plan of mid-2022," Redmond added.


Eligible devices are those with a Microsoft Account (an MSA for Home edition) and eligible Windows releases and compatibility (must run Window version 2004 or later and have at least the September 2021 updates).


You can check if your Windows 10 device is eligible for the Windows 11 upgrade using the [PC Health Check app](https://www.microsoft.com/windows/windows-11#pchealthcheck) or by checking [Windows 11 specs, features, and computer requirements](https://www.microsoft.com/windows/windows-11-specifications).

New Windows 11 features next month
----------------------------------


Panay also announced on Wednesday that Microsoft would be releasing new Windows 11 features in February.


The list includes a public preview of the Android Apps on Windows 11 feature, taskbar improvements, a new feature to share windows with remote users, and redesigned Media Player and Notepad apps.


"Windows now powers over 1.4 billion monthly active devices with overall time spent on Windows up 10% over pre pandemic levels," Panay [added](https://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/2022/01/26/a-new-era-of-the-pc/).
