Japanese multinational conglomerate Panasonic disclosed a security breach after unknown threat actors gained access to servers on its network this month.


"Panasonic Corporation has confirmed that its network was illegally accessed by a third party on November 11, 2021," the company said in a press release issued Friday.


"As the result of an internal investigation, it was determined that some data on a file server had been accessed during the intrusion."


Panasonic has reported the incident to the relevant authorities and has taken measures to prevent access to its network from external servers.


The Japanese electronics giant has also hired the services of a third party to investigate the attack—which Panasonic tagged as a "leak" in the press release—and find if any of the data accessed during the intrusion includes customer personal information.


"In addition to conducting its own investigation, Panasonic is currently working with a specialist third-party organization to investigate the leak and determine if the breach involved customers' personal information and/or sensitive information related to social infrastructure," the company [added](http://news.panasonic.com/global/press/data/2021/11/en211126-4/en211126-4.html).


A Panasonic spokesperson was not immediately available for comment when contacted by BleepingComputer.

Panasonic servers reportedly hacked in June
-------------------------------------------


While the press release issued doesn't include many details regarding the attack timeline, Japanese outlets, including [Mainichi](https://mainichi.jp/articles/20211126/k00/00m/040/326000c) and [NHK](https://www3.nhk.or.jp/news/html/20211126/k10013363971000.html), said the attackers had access to Panasonic's servers between June and November, as first reported by [The Record](https://therecord.media/panasonic-discloses-four-months-long-data-breach/).


Furthermore, they gained access to customer and employee sensitive information until Panasonic spotted the malicious activity on November 11.


The attack on Panasonic's server is part of a long series of other incidents involving Japanese companies in recent years.
