Law enforcement continues to keep up the pressure on ransomware operations with infrastructure hacks and million-dollar rewards, leading to the shut down of criminal operations.


Due to this increased pressure by law enforcement, the BlackMatter (DarkSide) ransomware gang announced to affiliates that they were [shutting down this week](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/blackmatter-ransomware-claims-to-be-shutting-down-due-to-police-pressure/) after members were missing.


BleepingComputer later discovered that BlackMatter began [moving existing victims to LockBit](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/blackmatter-ransomware-moves-victims-to-lockbit-after-shutdown/) ransomware's infrastructure to continue extortion demands.


To keep pressure on the DarkSide gang and warn that rebranding to a new operation won't stop law enforcement, the US Department of State announced a $10 million reward for identifying or locating key leaders in the organization. In addition, the US government is also offering $5 million for the arrest of any individuals participating in future attacks using DarkSide variants.


The FBI also issued advisories this week warning that [HelloKitty has added DDoS attacks](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/fbi-hellokitty-ransomware-adds-ddos-attacks-to-extortion-tactics/) to their arsenal, that ransomware gangs commonly conduct attacks "[during time-sensitive financial events](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/fbi-ransomware-targets-companies-during-mergers-and-acquisitions/)," and that gangs are [targeting tribal-owned businesses](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/fbi-ransomware-gangs-hit-several-tribal-owned-casinos-in-the-last-year/), including casinos.


Ransomware attacks we saw this week were against the [UK Labour Party](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/uk-labour-party-discloses-data-breach-after-ransomware-attack/) and the [Newfoundland and Labrador health systems](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/canadian-province-health-care-system-disrupted-by-cyberattack/).
