Twitter has started testing a new feature that allows users to sign up for an account using their existing Google account.


This new Google account integration feature is first being rolled out as an A/B test on Twitter.com (web), allowing users to sign up for Twitter using a Google account.

Historically, Twitter allows users to create a new account using a phone number or email address and a password.


For those enrolled in the tests, you will now be offered a new login option titled 'Sign up with Google,' as shown below.

Clicking on the 'Sign up with Google' link will open a dialog box from accounts.google.com, allowing you to use your Google account to register a new Twitter account.

The Google login feature is entirely optional, and there are no direct benefits to the integration other than faster signup and the ability to use your existing account on Twitter.


It appears that this feature started rolling out over the weekend and should become available to more users in the coming weeks or months.
