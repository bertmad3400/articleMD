Microsoft has added new security features for Microsoft Authenticator users that further secure the app and make it easier to roll out in enterprise environments.


[Microsoft Authenticator](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/authentication/concept-authentication-authenticator-app) is an authentication tool that helps users log into their accounts using 2FA (two-factor verification aka two-step authentication), passwordless sign-in, or password autofill.


As Microsoft Identity Division's Corporate VP of Program Management Alex Simons revealed Thursday:


1. Admins can now prevent accidental approvals in Microsoft Authenticator with number matching and additional context (Public Preview).
2. Admins can now setup GPS-location based Conditional Access policies using Microsoft Authenticator (GA).
3. Admins can now nudge their users to setup Microsoft Authenticator during sign-in using the Registration Campaign feature (GA).


By [enabling number matching](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/authentication/how-to-mfa-number-match) in Microsoft Authenticator push notifications and [additional context in requests](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/authentication/how-to-mfa-additional-context), admins will improve user sign-in security across the organizations.


They can also make use of Conditional Access policies to restrict access to corporate resource access to a specific geographic area with the help of [Microsoft Authenticator GPS location info](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/conditional-access/location-condition).


Last but not least, Microsoft now allows [pushing users who haven't yet set up Authenticator to install and use it](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/authentication/how-to-mfa-registration-campaign) as a more secure alternative to SMS-based MFA authentication.

Redmond provides information on [how to set up Microsoft Authenticator](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/account-billing/set-up-an-authenticator-app-as-a-two-factor-verification-method-2db39828-15e1-4614-b825-6e2b524e7c95) as your preferred 2FA verification method on its documentation site.


In September, the company also announced that it [started rolling out passwordless login support](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/microsoft/microsoft-rolls-out-passwordless-login-for-all-microsoft-accounts/) to all Microsoft accounts, allowing customers to sign in to Microsoft accounts without using a password.


It first allowed enterprise customers to rollout passwordless authentication in their environments [in March](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/azure-active-directory-identity/passwordless-authentication-is-now-generally-available/ba-p/1994700) following a breakthrough year in 2020 when [Microsoft reported that more than 150 million users](https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/2020/12/17/a-breakthrough-year-for-passwordless-technology/) were signing into their Azure Active Directory and Microsoft accounts via passwordless login.


You can find more information on how to use a passwordless method to sign in to your accounts on [Microsoft's support website](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/account-billing/strengthen-security-for-your-account-and-sign-in-faster-by-removing-your-password-4d4b4267-7d04-4402-9aac-4436a063d004).
