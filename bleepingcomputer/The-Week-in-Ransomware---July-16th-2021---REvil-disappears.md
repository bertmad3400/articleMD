Ransomware operations have been quieter this week as the [White House engages in talks with the Russian government](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/biden-asks-putin-to-crack-down-on-russian-based-ransomware-gangs/) about cracking down on cybercriminals believed to be operating in Russia.


This [increased scrutiny by law enforcement](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/interpol-urges-police-to-unite-against-potential-ransomware-pandemic/) and the growing fear that Russia is no longer a safe haven for cybercriminals has led to what is believed to be the [shutdown of the notorious REvil ransomware operation](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/revil-ransomware-gangs-web-sites-mysteriously-shut-down/).


Earlier this week, all of the infrastructures for the REvil ransomware operation shut down with no word from the public-facing representative 'Unknown' or the group's affiliates.


This shutdown is not believed to be caused by law enforcement, and it is likely we will see this group rebrand as a new operation in the future.


This week's other news includes finding a [Linux version of the HelloKitty ransomware](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/linux-version-of-hellokitty-ransomware-targets-vmware-esxi-servers/) used to target VMware ESXi servers and its virtual machines.


Finally, the US government launched the [StopRansomware](https://www.cisa.gov/stopransomware) site that includes information on protecting, mitigating, and recovering from ransomware attacks.


The US government announced a new initiative under the Rewards for Justice programs that will reward up to [$10 million for information about state-sponsored hackers](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/us-govt-offers-10-million-reward-for-tips-on-nation-state-hackers/) targeting critical infrastructure and US interests.

During our routine Open-source Intelligence (OSINT) research, we came across a new ransomware group named AvosLocker. It is a malicious program that infects Windows machines to encrypt document files of the victim and asks for ransom as part of its extortion program. AvosLocker appends the encrypted files with the extension **.avos** and forces victims to pay ransom for the decryption tool for recovering their data. The AvosLocker ransomware group uses spam email campaigns or distrustful advertisements as the primary delivery mechanisms for the malware. It uses a customized Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) with block size 256 to encrypt the data.
