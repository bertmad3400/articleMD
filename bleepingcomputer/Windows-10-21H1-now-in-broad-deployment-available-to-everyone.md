Microsoft has designated Windows 10, version 21H1 (aka the May 2021 Update) for broad deployment, making it available to everyone via Windows Update.


Windows 10 21H1 will be offered to all devices not configured to defer feature updates or affected by compatibility holds.


"Windows 10, version 21H1 is designated for broad deployment," the company [says](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/release-health/status-windows-10-21h1) in a Windows Health dashboard status update.


"As always, we recommend that you update your devices to the latest version of Windows 10 as soon as possible to ensure that you can take advantage of the latest features and advanced protections from the latest security threats."


Microsoft officially started rolling out [Windows 10 21H1](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/windows-10-2004/) in [May 2020](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/microsoft/windows-10-21h1-is-released-these-are-the-new-features/), but it hasn't been offered to all those checking for updates via Windows Update until now.


This is due to Windows Feature Updates entering [targeted deployment](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/surface-it-pro-blog/the-windows-semi-annual-channel-and-targeted-deployment/ba-p/328991#:~:text=Targeted%20deployment%20refers%20to%20the,most%20modern%20chipsets%20and%20capabilities.) right after release to test the quality of the build on targeted machines, including those with modern chipsets.


After Microsoft determines that a version is ready for deployment on most Windows 10 devices, they move it to "broad deployment," the next deployment phase.

Windows 10 21H1 is rolling out as an enablement package for Windows 10 2004 and Windows 10 20H2, allowing systems running these Windows versions to update very quickly and with a single restart, just like they would install a monthly update.


Since all 21H1 features are included in Windows 10 2004/20H2, the enablement package will act as a "master switch," enabling the dormant OS features.


On devices running older versions of Windows 10, you will need to install the full update, which will take longer.


You can also use the [Windows 10 Media Creation tool](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10) to upgrade or create an ISO for a clean install of Windows 10 21H1.


Additional information on installing the May 2021 Update on your system is available in the video embedded below.



Window 11 available for compatible devices
------------------------------------------


Microsoft also announced that it's rolling out the Windows 11 upgrade to "an expanded set of eligible devices" as part of a phased rollout designed to deliver a smoother upgrade experience.


Microsoft [released Windows 11 on October 5](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/microsoft/windows-11-is-released-what-you-need-to-know-and-new-features/) for systems with [compatible hardware](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/microsoft/microsoft-publishes-the-windows-11-system-requirements/) that also run Windows 10 2004 and later and have installed at least the September 2021 updates.


"If you are using Windows 10, you can determine if your device is eligible for the upgrade using the [PC Health Check app](https://www.microsoft.com/windows/windows-11#pchealthcheck) or checking [Windows 11 specs, features, and computer requirements](https://www.microsoft.com/windows/windows-11-specifications)," Microsoft says.


"If you have an eligible device, open Windows Update Settings and select **Check for updates**. Once the upgrade is ready for your device, you will see the option to download and install."


According to previously available info, Redmond estimates that the Windows 11 upgrade will be offered to all eligible Windows 10 devices by mid-2022.
