What's new in the KB5005565 cumulative update
---------------------------------------------


With the KB5005565 update, Microsoft has addressed a bug that causes Bluetooth headsets to only work for voice calls and another bug that provides the wrong Furigana result when you cancel the Japanese reconversion.


The company has also updated an issue that resets syncing for Microsoft OneDrive to “Known folders only” after you install a Windows update.


After installing this update, Windows 10 2004 will be updated to build 19041.1237, Windows 10 20H2 will be updated to build 19042.1237, and Windows 10 21H1 will be updated to build 19043.1237.


This cumulative update comes with the following highlighted fixes:


* Addresses an issue that causes PowerShell to create an infinite number of child directories. This issue occurs when you use the PowerShell **Move-Item** command to move a directory to one of its children. As a result, the volume fills up and the system stops responding.


* Updates a rare condition that causes Bluetooth headsets to only work for voice calls.


* Updates an issue that provides the wrong Furigana result when you cancel the Japanese reconversion.


* Updates an issue that resets syncing for Microsoft OneDrive to “Known folders only” after you install a Windows update.

* Updates an issue with resizing images that might produce flickering and residual line artifacts.


* Updates an issue that prevents you from typing any words in the username box during the out-of-box experience (OOBE) process. This issue occurs when you use the Chinese Input Method Editor (IME).


* Updates an issue with copying and pasting a text box into Office 365 apps. If you use an IME, you won’t be able to insert text into the text box.


* Updates an issue that might cause your device to stop working when making a touch input gesture. This issue occurs if you bring more fingers into contact with the touchpad or screen during the middle of the gesture.


* Updates an issue that might cause an external monitor to display a black screen after Hibernation. This issue might occur when the external monitor connects to a docking station using a certain hardware interface.


* Updates an issue that resets the brightness for standard dynamic range (SDR) content on high-dynamic range (HDR) monitors. This occurs after you restart your device or reconnect to the device remotely.
