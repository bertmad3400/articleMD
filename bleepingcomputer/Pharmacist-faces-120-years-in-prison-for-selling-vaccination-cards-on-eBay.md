An Illionois pharmacist arrested today faces 120 years in prison for allegedly selling dozens of authentic COVID-19 vaccination record cards issued by the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).


"Knowingly selling COVID vaccination cards to unvaccinated individuals puts millions of Americans at risk of serious injury or death," said FBI Special Agent in Charge Emmerson Buie Jr.


"To put such a small price on the safety of our nation is not only an insult to those who are doing their part in the fight to stop COVID-19, but a federal crime with serious consequences."

34-year-old Tangtang Zhao from Chicago worked as a licensed pharmacist for a nationwide chain of stores and pharmacies that also distributed and administered COVID-19 vaccines.


According to the [indictment](https://www.justice.gov/opa/press-release/file/1425031/download), Zhao sold 134 real vaccination cards to 11 buyers who paid him roughly $1276, amounting to around $10 per vaccination card.


Zhao is now being charged with 12 counts of theft of government property, facing ten years in prison for each of the counts if found guilty.


He made his initial court appearance on Tuesday before US Magistrate Judge Sheila M. Finnegan of the US District Court for the Northern District of Illinois.


"We take seriously, and will vigorously investigate, any criminal offense that contributes to the distrust around vaccines and vaccination status," [added](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/pharmacist-arrested-selling-covid-vaccination-cards-online) Assistant Attorney General Kenneth A. Polite Jr. of DOJ's Criminal Division.


"The Department of Justice and its law enforcement partners are committed to protecting the American people from these offenses during this national emergency."

Warnings not to sell or buy vaccination cards
---------------------------------------------


In March, US federal agencies [warned the public](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/us-govt-warns-that-buying-fake-covid-19-vaccine-cards-is-a-crime/) against making or selling fake COVID-19 vaccination record cards to avoid breaking the law.


The FBI, the Department of Health and Human Services, and the Office of Inspector General (HHS-OIG) also warned against filling in blank vaccination record cards with false information.


"By misrepresenting yourself as vaccinated when entering schools, mass transit, workplaces, gyms, or places of worship, you put yourself and others around you at risk of contracting COVID-19," the federal agencies said.


The warning came after alerts issued by the [FBI](https://www.fbi.gov/contact-us/field-offices/elpaso/news/press-releases/fbi-el-paso-warns-about-not-posting-your-cdc-covid-19-vaccination-card-on-social-media-platforms) and the [Federal Trade Commission (FTC)](https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/blog/2021/02/social-media-no-place-covid-19-vaccination-cards) warning not to post photos of CDC COVID-19 vaccination cards on social media platforms.
