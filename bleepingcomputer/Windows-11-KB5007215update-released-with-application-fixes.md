What's new in the Windows 10 KB5007215 update
---------------------------------------------


After installing the KB5007215 update, Windows 11 will have its build number changed to 22000.318.


Last week, Microsoft added a new known issue for apps using GDI+ that prevented drawing or the proper display of user interface elements.


With this update, Microsoft has fixed this issue, and GDI+ applications should be working again.


"Addresses an issue in which certain apps might have unexpected results when rendering some user interface elements or when drawing within the app," explains Microsoft in the KB5007215 support bulletin


"You might encounter this issue with apps that use GDI+ and set a zero (0) width pen object on displays with high dots per inch (DPI) or resolution, or if the app is using scaling."


This update also includes a fix, previously released in [Friday's OOB update](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/microsoft/windows-11-kb5008295-emergency-update-fixes-built-in-app-mess/), that replaces an expired certificate [preventing built-in features from working](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/microsoft/some-windows-11-apps-are-broken-due-to-expired-certificate/).


The built-in features that were affected include:


* Snipping Tool
* Accounts page and landing page in the Settings app (S mode only)
* Start menu (S mode only)
* Touch Keyboard
* Voice Typing
* Emoji Panel
* Input Method Editor user interface
* and "Getting started" and "Tips" dialogs.


Microsoft also states that they made changes to the servicing stack to resolve bugs or issues preventing Windows updates from properly being installed.
