A Microsoft 365 outage prevents access to files, such as Excel documents, stored on the SharePoint Online, OneDrive, Office, and Microsoft Teams cloud storage services.


The outage started at approximately 11:40 AM EST, with admins and users reporting on social media that they could not open files stored on OneDrive or SharePoint.

Most of the reports so far are about Excel users not being able to open files stored on OneDrive and SharePoint.


Soon after, Microsoft issued a Microsoft 365 Service Alert titled, 'Users can't access files in Microsoft 365 services.'


"Impacted services may include, but aren't limited to, SharePoint Online, OneDrive for Business, Microsoft Teams, and Microsoft 365 apps," explains the alert.


Microsoft says they will provide a further update in thirty minutes as they investigate the cause of the outage.
