TV stations owned by the Sinclair Broadcast Group broadcast television company went down over the weekend across the US, with multiple sources telling BleepingComputer a ransomware attack caused the downtime.


Sinclair Broadcast Group is a Fortune 500 media company (with annual revenues of [$5.9 billion in 2020](https://www.baltimoresun.com/business/bs-bz-sinclair-broadcast-mccormick-trowe-celebrate-rise-to-fortune-500-20210621-76uctyrjtjf5nchy6jeewg7r5e-story.html)) and a leading local sports and news provider that owns multiple national networks.


Its operations include 185 television stations affiliated with Fox, ABC, CBS, NBC, and The CW (including 21 regional sports network brands), with approximately 620 channels in 87 markets across the US (amounting to almost 40% of all US households).


This is the second incident that impacted Sinclair's TV stations in July 2021, when the company asked all Sinclair stations [to change passwords](https://www.ftvlive.com/sqsp-test/2021/7/6/sinclair-hit-with-cyber-attack) "as quickly as possible" following [a security breach](https://www.ftvlive.com/sqsp-test/2021/7/7/sinclair-cyber-attack).


Ransomware attack likely behind TV stations going down
------------------------------------------------------


Sources have told BleepingComputer that a ransomware attack caused these significant technical issues. The attackers have been able to impact many TV stations via Sinclair's corporate Active Directory domain.


BleepingComputer was also told that they shut down Active Directory services for the domain, leading to wide disruption throughout the entire organization and affiliates by blocking access to domain resources across the network


Several corporate assets were taken down in the incident, including the email servers, broadcasting, and newsroom systems, forcing TV stations to create Gmail accounts to receive news tips from viewers and use PowerPoint for newscasts graphics.

While regional sports channels were largely not affected by the incident, there are reports that, in some US markets, local NFL games were replaced by national sports programming (such as bowling).


Because of the ongoing issues, some stations were also forced to [switch to live Facebook streams](https://twitter.com/CBS6Leanne/status/1449865069299478530) instead of their regular newscasts, while others were forced to delay evening newscasts altogether [[1](https://twitter.com/TrishaWWMT/status/1449821689475477510), [2](https://twitter.com/CBS6Heather/status/1449710582937047044)].

Sinclair TV stations slowly recovering
--------------------------------------


Since reports of Sinclair TV stations going down began coming in, as first reported by [The Record](https://therecord.media/sinclair-tv-stations-disrupted-across-the-us-in-apparent-ransomware-attack/), some of them have managed to start broadcasting again. However, it's evident that the incident severely impacted them.


For instance, a source told BleepingComputer that, even though KABB is back up, they have issues with weather graphics.


WCHS is also up, with news stories from Fox NewsEdge being streamed straight out of a browser window in fullscreen, with WPGH and KOKH also having problems displaying their standard graphics


Others, like WBSF and WCWN, are now broadcasting different programming, switching from CW programming to "Charge!" subchannels.


A handful seems to have been more severely affected, such as WPFO, which did a half-hour newscast instead of the usual full hour, and WTAT and WRGB, who had to cancel their newscasts altogether.


*A Sinclair spokesperson was not immediately available for comment when contacted by BleepingComputer.*
