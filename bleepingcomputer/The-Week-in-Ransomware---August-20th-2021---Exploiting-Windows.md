Ransomware gangs continue to attack schools, companies, and even hospitals worldwide with little sign of letting up. Below we have tracked some of the ransomware stories that we are following this week.


Stories of particular interest revolve around new features and tactics used by some of the ransomware operations.



After analyzing the [Conti training material leaked earlier this month](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/angry-conti-ransomware-affiliate-leaks-gangs-attack-playbook/), we learned that they use a legitimate remote access software to retain persistence on a compromised network. We also learned that they prioritize searching[for cyber insurance policies and financial documents](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/conti-ransomware-prioritizes-revenue-and-cyberinsurance-data-theft/) after taking control of a network.


Another report illustrates how threat actors are tracking researchers on Twitter as a new ransomware gang known as [LockFile uses the PetitPotam attack](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/lockfile-ransomware-uses-petitpotam-attack-to-hijack-windows-domains/) to take over Windows domains.


Some of the attacks we saw this week were against the [Brazilian National Treasury](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/brazilian-government-discloses-national-treasury-ransomware-attack/), [Memorial Health System](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/hive-ransomware-attacks-memorial-health-system-steals-patient-data/), and Japanese insurer [Tokio Marine](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/japanese-insurer-tokio-marine-discloses-ransomware-attack/).


Finally, there is some good news, as Emsisoft has released a [SynAck ransomware decryptor](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/synack-ransomware-decryptor-lets-victims-recover-files-for-free/) after the [master decryption keys were released](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/synack-ransomware-releases-decryption-keys-after-el-cometa-rebrand/) by the threat actors earlier this month.
