The popular Zero2Automated malware analysis and reverse-engineering course is having another Black Friday and Cyber Monday promotion this year, where you can get 20% off all courses on their site.


Started in May 2020 by two well-known reverse engineers, [Vitali Kremez](https://twitter.com/VK_Intel) and Daniel Bunce (aka [0verfl0w\_](https://twitter.com/0verfl0w_)), [Zero2Automated](https://zero2auto.com/) is more than just an online training course.


Instead, participants also participate in an online community where students can chat with their peers and teachers as they work their way through a 25+ hours of malware analysis and reverse engineering content.


Last year, BleepingComputer [spoke to some of the students](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/from-zero-to-hero-zero2automated-malware-reverse-engineering-course/) taking the course and was told there "are no malware analysis courses like this one anywhere else."
