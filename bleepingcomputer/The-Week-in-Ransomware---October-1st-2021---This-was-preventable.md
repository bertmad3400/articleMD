This week comes with reports on a hospital ransomware attack that led to the death of a baby and new efforts by governments worldwide to combat ransomware.


This week, the biggest news is President Biden announcing a [partnership between the USA and thirty other countries](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/us-unites-30-countries-to-disrupt-global-ransomware-attacks/) to disrupt global ransomware attacks.


A heartbreaking report by the Wall Street Journal about a [ransomware attack leading to the death of a baby](http://www.wsj.com/articles/ransomware-hackers-hospital-first-alleged-death-11633008116) also illustrates how dangerous these attacks can be for health care.


There was also some interesting news about how [Conti targets Veeam backups](http://www.advintel.io/post/backup-removal-solutions-from-conti-ransomware-with-love), how the RansomExx ransomware can [incorrectly encrypt Linux files](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/ransomexx-ransomware-linux-encryptor-may-damage-victims-files/), and the reemergence of the [ransomware group known as Apostle](http://www.sentinelone.com/labs/new-version-of-apostle-ransomware-reemerges-in-targeted-attack-on-higher-education/).


Ransomware attacks this week include [JVCKenwood](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/jvckenwood-hit-by-conti-ransomware-claiming-theft-of-15tb-data/), [Hawaii Payroll Services](http://www.govtech.com/security/thousands-affected-by-ransomware-attack-on-hawaii-company), and [Lufkin ISD](https://www.ktre.com/2021/09/28/lufkin-isd-hit-by-ransomware-attack/).
