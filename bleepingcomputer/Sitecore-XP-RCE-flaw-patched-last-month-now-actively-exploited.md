The Australian Cyber Security Center (ACSC) is alerting web admins of the active exploitation of CVE-2021-42237, a remote code execution flaw in the Sitecore Experience Platform (Sitecore XP).


Sitecore XP is an enterprise-level content management system with data analytics (CMS) used by well-known companies, including American Express, IKEA, Carnival Cruise Lines, L'Oréal, and Volvo.


On October 13th, [Sitecore disclosed and released a patch](http://support.sitecore.com/kb?id=kb_article_view&sysparm_article=KB1000776) for a pre-authentication remote code execution vulnerability tracked as [CVE-2021-42237](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-42237) affecting the Sitecore Experience Platform.


Last week, cybersecurity firm Assetnote published [a technical write-up](https://blog.assetnote.io/2021/11/02/sitecore-rce/) on vulnerability allowing hackers to use the details to create exploits and actively exploit vulnerable websites.


"There is active exploitation of a vulnerability occurring in certain versions of Sitecore Experience Platform systems. Affected Australian organisation should apply the available security update," warned the ACSC in a [new advisory](http://www.cyber.gov.au/acsc/view-all-content/alerts/active-exploitation-vulnerable-sitecore-experience-platform-content-management-systems) released Friday.


The vulnerable Sitecore XP component used in the attacks is Report.ashx, which provides a high-level view of analytics, engagement, and SEO success.


"This issue is related to a remote code execution vulnerability through insecure deserialization in the**Report.ashx** file. This file was used to drive the Executive Insight Dashboard (of Silverlight report) that was [deprecated](https://support.sitecore.com/kb?id=kb_article_view&sysparm_article=KB0990938 "deprecated") in 8.0 Initial Release," explains Sitecore in their security advisory.


The vulnerability does not require authentication, and it allows any remote attacker to exploit a vulnerable server and gain complete control over it.


However, after Microsoft deprecated Silverlight, this Sitecore XP functionality was deprecated in version 8.0, causing only specific platform versions to be affected by the vulnerability.


The Sitecore XP versions affected by the RCE vulnerability are:


* Sitecore XP 7.5 Initial Release – Sitecore XP 7.5 Update-2
* Sitecore XP 8.0 Initial Release – Sitecore XP 8.0 Update-7
* Sitecore XP 8.1 Initial Release – Sitecore XP 8.1 Update-3
* Sitecore XP 8.2 Initial Release – Sitecore XP 8.2 Update-7


This vulnerability affects all versions of Sitecore XP, including all "single-instance and multi-instance environments, Managed Cloud environments, and all Sitecore server roles (Content Delivery, Content Editing, Reporting, Processing, etc.), which are exposed to the Internet."


The recommended solution is to upgrade to a secure version, ideally Sitecore XP 9.0 or higher.


Alternatively, you can mitigate the flaw by deleting the Report.ashx file from "**/sitecore/shell/ClientBin/Reporting/Report.ashx**"on all server instances.
