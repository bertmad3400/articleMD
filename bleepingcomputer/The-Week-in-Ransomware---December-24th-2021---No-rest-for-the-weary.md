The holiday season is here, but there is no rest for our weary admins as ransomware gangs are still conducting attacks over the Christmas and New Years breaks.


This is especially true this year, with the rampant Log4j exploitation over the past few weeks leading to compromised networks that are ripe for ransomware deployment while the workforce is on vacation.


Network admins and security researchers are already reporting that BlackCat/ALPHV affiliates continue to attack the enterprise today as we move into the Christmas weekend, so it is vital to keep an eye on your networks and respond quickly to unusual behavior.


Good luck out there and wishing everyone a very happy and **uneventful** holiday season!
