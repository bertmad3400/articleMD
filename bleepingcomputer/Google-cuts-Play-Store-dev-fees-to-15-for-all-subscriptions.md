Google announced that they are dropping the 30% flat service fee for in-app purchases or app sales to 15% starting January 1, 2022. 


The tech giant previously offered this discount after 12 months of a recurring subscription, but with this announcement, they are now making everyone eligible from day one to receive this discount from day one.


This applies to all application developers who offer a paid app or sell in-app digital goods and services.


Google says this corresponds to roughly 3% of registered developers, as the rest distribute free apps that follow indirect monetization methods. 


Also, based on the earning amounts and the previous service fee model, 99% of those subject to charges qualified for a 15% fee already. 


The new service fee model dictates the following: 


* The service fee is 15% for the first $1 million of earnings each year when enrolled and 30% subsequently, which gives smaller developers more help as they scale their business.
* The fee for all subscriptions revenue is 15%, reflecting developer investment in keeping subscribers for the long run.
* Developers in certain programs, like the Play Media Experience Program, may be eligible for a reduced fee based on high content costs.


In addition to the apps on the Play Store, Google has also announced fee reductions for e-books and music streaming services on the platform, taking its cut down to 10% under certain eligibility conditions. 


Ongoing investigations

Google’s [announcement](https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2021/10/evolving-business-model.html) says that the business model change results from listening to developers and consumers and trying to better cater to their needs. 


With Google targeted by a barrage of anti-trust law violation [probes](https://www.law360.com/articles/1401160) launched across the globe, contract breach claims from developers, and an ever-tightening clamp of scrutiny around its business models, this reduced fee may be seen as an olive branch to developers.


While this is a positive development for Android app creators, it remains to see if developers pass on these savings to consumers.
