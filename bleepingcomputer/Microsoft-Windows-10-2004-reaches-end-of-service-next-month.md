Microsoft has reminded users today that all editions of Windows 10, version 2004 and Windows Server, version 2004 (also known as the Windows 10 May 2020 Update), will reach end of servicing on December 14, 2021.


For products that [reach their end of support](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/search/?&q=end+of+support), Redmond stops providing technical support, quality updates, and security fixes for newly discovered vulnerabilities.


Customers still using [end of service software](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/search/?&q=end+of+service) are advised to upgrade to the latest version of Windows 10 (21H1 aka the May 2021 Update) or to Windows 11 (if they have eligible devices) as soon as possible to keep their systems secure and bug-free.


"Your computer will still work, but it could become more vulnerable to security risks and viruses because you won’t receive new security updates or other quality updates," Microsoft [explains](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4035050/windows-10-serviced-versions-frequently-asked-questions).


"Microsoft offers complimentary support to ensure that your device has the latest updates installed and requires that your device be up to date before assisting with other technical support issues."


Update to Windows 21H1
----------------------


Starting November 4, Microsoft [designated Windows 10 21H1 for broad deployment](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/microsoft/windows-10-21h1-now-in-broad-deployment-available-to-everyone/), thus making it available to everyone via Windows Update.


The May 2021 Update is now being offered to all devices not affected by compatibility holds or configured to defer feature updates.


Windows 10 21H1 feature update can also be deployed using the [Media Creation Tool](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10) or [Windows Server Update Services (WSUS)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/windows-server-update-services/get-started/windows-server-update-services-wsus).


Microsoft officially started rolling out [Windows 10 21H1](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/windows-10-2004/) in [May 2020](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/microsoft/windows-10-21h1-is-released-these-are-the-new-features/), but it hasn't been offered to all those checking for updates via Windows Update until now.


Redmond [started auto-updating](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/microsoft/microsoft-starts-autoupdating-windows-10-2004-to-windows-10-21h1/) Windows 10 2004 devices to Windows 10 21H1 on June 5 and announced they have [begun auto-upgrading a larger number of Windows 10 devices](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/microsoft/microsoft-begins-autoupdating-more-devices-to-windows-10-21h1/) nearing the end of life to Windows 10 21H1 on June 22.


Microsoft will release Windows 10 21H2, the next update, during the second half of 2021 with "a scoped set of features focused on productivity and security."

Windows 11 available for compatible devices
-------------------------------------------


Microsoft is also rolling out the Windows 11 upgrade to "an expanded set of eligible devices" in a phased rollout to provide users with a smoother upgrade experience.


Microsoft [released Windows 11](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/microsoft/windows-11-is-released-what-you-need-to-know-and-new-features/) on October 5 for systems with [compatible hardware](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/microsoft/microsoft-publishes-the-windows-11-system-requirements/) running Windows 10 2004 or higher and had installed at least the September 2021 updates.


"If you are using Windows 10, you can determine if your device is eligible for the upgrade using the [PC Health Check app](https://www.microsoft.com/windows/windows-11#pchealthcheck) or checking [Windows 11 specs, features, and computer requirements](https://www.microsoft.com/windows/windows-11-specifications)," Microsoft says.


"If you have an eligible device, open Windows Update Settings and select **Check for updates**. Once the upgrade is ready for your device, you will see the option to download and install."


Redmond estimates that Windows 11 will be offered as an upgrade to all compatible Windows 10 devices until the summer of 2022.
