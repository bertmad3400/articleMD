This week's news focuses on the aftermath of REvil's ransomware attack on MSPs and customers using zero-day vulnerabilities in Kaseya VSA. The good news is that it has not been as disruptive as we initially feared.


As REvil performed their attack remotely, they never had access to the victims' networks and thus could not delete backups or steal data.



With the lack of this leverage, victims are [restoring from backups rather than paying](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/revil-victims-are-refusing-to-pay-after-flawed-kaseya-ransomware-attack/) the ransom.


Sadly, this attack was close to being prevented as Kaseya worked[on patches for the zero-day vulnerabilities](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/kaseya-was-fixing-zero-day-just-as-revil-ransomware-sprung-their-attack/) just as the attacks started.


Due to constant ransomware attacks on US interests, [President Biden has once against warned President Putin](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/us-warns-of-action-against-ransomware-gangs-if-russia-refuses/) that Russia needs to arrest the ransomware gangs operating from Russia or the US will take action instead.


Finally, a new ransomware payment tracking site called [Ransomwhere](http://ransomwhe.re/) was launched this week.
