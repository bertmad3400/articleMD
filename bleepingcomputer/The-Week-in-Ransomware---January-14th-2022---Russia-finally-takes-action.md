Today, the Russian government announced that they [arrested fourteen members of the REvil ransomware gang](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/russia-arrests-revil-ransomware-gang-members-seize-66-million/) on behalf of US authorities.


While the ransomware gang members are only being charged with "illegal circulation of means of payment," the arrests are the first public action by Russia to stem the activities of ransomware gangs operating within the country.


Furthermore, Russia states that they took this action on behalf of US law enforcement, who they have historically been reluctant to help in criminal cybercrime investigations.


However, some threat actors believe that this is just Russia trying to appease the USA and that future law enforcement cooperation will not be common.


Ukrainian police also [arrested members of a ransomware operation](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/ukranian-police-arrests-ransomware-gang-that-hit-over-50-firms/) who encrypted at least fifty firms in the USA and Europe. However, the name of the ransomware gang has not been disclosed.
