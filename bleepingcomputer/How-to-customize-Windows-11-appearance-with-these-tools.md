Windows 11 is arriving later this year and it's currently available to testers in the Windows Insider program. If you've already installed the new operating system and you want to get the most out of Windows 11, you can try the third-party programs highlighted below.

Like Windows 10, Windows 11 also comes with bloatware in some form or another. For those unfamiliar, bloatware is a subjective term and can range from apps installed by your OEMs, company and Microsoft. Bloatware like Paint 3D does nothing but take up precious space.


Windows 11 allows you to remove a number of unwanted apps and features by making changes to the settings. With a new app called ThisIsWin11, you can customize advanced and basic Windows 11 features from one place and remove bloatware by turning off features like Microsoft Teams integration.


The app currently comes with the following features:


* Basis settings: It allows you to quickly configure the basic settings of Windows 11.
* PumpedApp: You can check and optimize Windows 11 by making changes to the PowerThrottling.
* Bloatware: This will feature will allow you to remove the pre-installed Windows 11 apps.
* Quickly install apps using packages.
* PowerClicks: This allows you to automate Windows tasks using PowerShell scripts.

Start11
-------
