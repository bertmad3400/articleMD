Microsoft has confirmed a new issue impacting devices running Windows 11, version 21H2, where apps using Win32 APIs to render colors on some high dynamic range (HDR) displays may not work as expected.


[HDR](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/what-is-hdr-in-windows-11-f5fbf5cb-149d-4a0d-8be1-9ed78c68d3b4) displays come with a notably increased range of color because they support a wider color gamut, resulting in more vivid colors than standard dynamic range (SDR) ones, a well as more precise colors due to added support for more color shades.


However, customers might experience color rendering problems due to this newly acknowledged Windows 11 bug.


"After installing Windows 11, some image editing programs might not render colors correctly on certain HDR displays," Microsoft [explained](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/release-health/status-windows-11-21h2#2768msgdesc) on the Windows Health Dashboard.


"This is frequently observed with white colors, which could display in bright yellow or other colors. This issue occurs when certain color-rendering Win32 APIs return unexpected information or errors under specific conditions."


Microsoft has added that not all profile management programs are impacted by this known issue.


Furthermore, Windows 11 color profile options on the Settings page, such as the Microsoft Color Control Panel, should function correctly on affected systems.


Fix coming in late January
--------------------------


Redmond is currently working on a fix that is expected to be available for release during late January.
