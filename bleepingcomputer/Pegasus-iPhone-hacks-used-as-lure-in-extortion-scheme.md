A new extortion scam is underway that attempts to capitalize on the recent Pegasus iOS spyware attacks to scare people into paying a blackmail demand.


Last month, Amnesty International and non-profit project Forbidden Stories revealed that the [Pegasus spyware was installed on fully updated iPhones](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/iphones-running-latest-ios-hacked-to-deploy-nso-group-spyware/) through a zero-day zero-click iMessage vulnerability.



A zero-click vulnerability is a bug that can be exploited on a device without any interaction by the user. For example, if just visiting a website or receiving a message could exploit a vulnerability, this would be considered a zero-click hack.


It is believed that governments used this software to monitor the communication of politicians, journalists, human rights activists, and business executives worldwide.


Capitalizing on Pegasus spyware fears
-------------------------------------


This week, a threat actor began emailing recipients, telling them that their iPhone device was hacked with a 'zero-click' vulnerability to install the Pegasus spyware software.


The scammer says that they have been using Pegasus to monitor the recipient's activities and have created videos of them during "the most private moments" of their lives.


The email warns that if a 0.035 bitcoin (approximately $1,600) payment is not paid, the threat actors will send the videos to the recipient's family, friends, and business associates.

Thankfully, there have been no payments to the bitcoin address listed in the sample email seen by BleepingComputer. However, other cryptocurrency addresses may be used as part of this scam.


You may be thinking that nobody would fall for this scam, but similar schemes have [generated over $50,000 in a week](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/adult-site-blackmail-spammers-made-over-50k-in-one-week/) in the past.


While receiving these types of emails can be anxiety-provoking, always remember that they are scams, and you should just mark them as spam and delete the email.
