January Windows updates issues and fixes
----------------------------------------


As [BleepingComputer reported after this month's Patch Tuesday](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/microsoft/new-windows-server-updates-cause-dc-boot-loops-break-hyper-v/), the latest Windows Server updates were causing a series of severe issues for administrators.


According to admin reports, Windows domain controllers were being plagued by spontaneous reboots, Hyper-V was no longer starting on Windows servers, and Windows Resilient File System (ReFS) volumes were no longer accessible after deploying the January 2021 updates.


Windows 10 users and administrators also reported problems with L2TP VPN connections after installing the recent Windows 10 and Windows 11 cumulative updates and seeing "Can't connect to VPN." errors.


**Those who cannot immediately install today's out-of-band updates** can remove the KB5009624, KB5009557, KB5009555, KB5009566, and KB5009543 updates causing these issues from an [Elevated Command Prompt](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tutorials/how-to-open-a-windows-10-elevated-command-prompt/) with the following commands:



```
Windows Server 2012 R2: wusa /uninstall /kb:KB5009624 
Windows Server 2019: wusa /uninstall /kb:KB5009557 
Windows Server 2022: wusa /uninstall /kb:KB5009555
Windows 10: wusa /uninstall /kb:5009543
Windows 11: wusa /uninstall /kb:5009566
```

However, since Microsoft also bundles all the security updates with these Windows cumulative updates, removing them will also remove all fixes for vulnerabilities patched during the January 2021 Patch Tuesday. 


Windows admins and users need to consider the risks of unpatched vulnerabilities impacting their systems versus the disruption caused by the issues stemming from this month's Windows updates.
