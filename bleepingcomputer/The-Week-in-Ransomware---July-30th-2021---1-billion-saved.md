Ransomware continues to be active this week, with new threat actors releasing new features, No More Ransom turning five, and a veteran group rebrands.


This week marked the [fifth anniversary of No More Ransomware](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/no-more-ransom-saves-almost-1-billion-in-ransomware-payments-in-5-years/), where they announced that they had saved €1 billion in ransom payments through the decryptors on their platform.


We also saw ransomware groups continue to innovate with [LockBit 2.0 now using group policies](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/lockbit-ransomware-now-encrypts-windows-domains-using-group-policies/) to automate the deployment of their ransomware over a Windows domain.


I shared what I know about the [inner conflict of the Babuk ransomware gang](http://twitter.com/LawrenceAbrams/status/1420141842067300354) that led to the Admin starting a [new RAMP cybercrime forum](http://ke-la.com/new-russian-speaking-forum-a-new-place-for-raas/) and the rest of the team launching Babuk version 2.0.


Finally, [DoppelPaymber has rebranded](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/doppelpaymer-ransomware-gang-rebrands-as-the-grief-group/) as a new ransomware operation known as Grief, which began operating in May.
