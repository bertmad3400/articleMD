Microsoft has announced that Window Server 2022, a Long Term Servicing Channel (LTSC) release with ten years of support, is generally available starting today.


"It’s a big step forward for the operating system that is trusted by major corporations and small businesses alike to run their business and mission-critical workloads," Microsoft's Bernardo Caldas [said](https://cloudblogs.microsoft.com/windowsserver/2021/09/01/windows-server-2022-now-generally-available-delivers-innovation-in-security-hybrid-and-containers/) today.


"With Windows Server 2022, customers can continue to securely run their workloads, enable new hybrid cloud scenarios, and modernize their applications to meet evolving business requirements."


While the general availability of Windows Server 2022 was just revealed, the new release was made available to customers via the Volume Licensing Service Center and began rolling out to mainstream users almost two weeks ago, as ZDNet [reported](https://www.zdnet.com/article/microsofts-windows-server-2022-is-rolling-out-to-mainstream-users/).


Furthermore, the company also updated [its lifecycle page](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/lifecycle/products/windows-server-2022) to show that the support start date for the new Windows Server version started on August 18, with the Mainstream End Date set on October 13, 2026, and the Extended End Date set to October 14, 2031.
