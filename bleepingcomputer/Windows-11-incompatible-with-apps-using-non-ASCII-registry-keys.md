Microsoft is blocking Windows 11 upgrades if customers use applications that create registry keys using some non-ASCII characters.


As the company explains, on impacted systems such apps might be unable to open and could also cause other issues or errors in Windows 11, version 21H2 including blue screens.


"Compatibility issues have been found between apps using some non-ASCII characters in their registry keys or subkeys and Windows 11," Microsoft explains.


"Affected apps might be unable to open and might cause other issues or errors in Windows, including the possibility of receiving an error with a blue screen."


To make things even worse, in some cases, registry keys with non-ASCII characters might also be irreparable.


Even thought it doesn't say it on the known issue's Windows Health dashboard [entry](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/release-health/status-windows-11-21h2#1698msgdesc), Microsoft has merged it with a previous bug preventing Cốc Cốc browser users to upgrade to Windows 11.


"If your organization is using [Update Compliance](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/deployment/update/update-compliance-monitor), the safeguard ID for devices with Cốc Cốc browser is 35891494," Redmond says.


Microsoft has applied a compatibility hold to safeguard the users' experience by blocking affected Windows devices from being offered or installing Windows 11.


Customers are also advised not to attempt to manually upgrade via the *Update now* button or to use the Media Creation Tool until a fix is available.

To protect against potential upgrade issues, Microsoft has placed safeguard holds for some of the above issues to prevents users from upgrading to Windows 11.


Microsoft are investigating the issues, with updates to address them to be released with the October Patch Tuesday for some of them.


[Windows 11 was released worldwide last week](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/microsoft/windows-11-is-released-what-you-need-to-know-and-new-features/) and is now rolling it out via Windows Update to new Windows 10 devices and to those pre-loaded with Windows 11.
