Since Thursday evening, Google has been investigating reports of customers having issues enrolling their Chromebooks with a network error.


According to user reports, "network not available" errors are displayed on the screen after booting into Chrome OS and trying to enroll the devices.


The steps to reproduce this issue include:


1. Booting the Chrome OS device
2. Attempting to enroll the device
3. Connecting to a network
4. "Network not available" shown on the screen


Google engineers started investigating the reports yesterday afternoon, at 4:26 PM GMT+3, and said in an update issued today at 11:19 GMT+3 that the issue is mitigated.


However, Google's customer care portal still shows the issue as ongoing and tagged with a "Partially Resolved" status.

This is likely because they deployed a server-side fix that's still rolling out to all impacted Chromebook devices.


To get the fix quicker, you can [check for updates yourself](https://partnerdash.google.com/apps/simulator/chromebook#update-your-chromebook?l=en) by connecting the device to Wi-Fi, going into Settings > About Chrome OS, and selecting "Check for updates."


If the Chromebook finds a software update, it will start downloading and installing it automatically.


In September, Google also [fixed an issue causing black screens](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/google/google-chromebook-bug-causes-black-screens-after-login/) to show up on users' Chromebooks when attempting to log into their Chrome OS accounts.


Some reports [said at the time](https://twitter.com/AlexHankel/status/1437829315400388611) that 80% of users on a network weren't able to sign in since they were kicked back onto the login screen automatically.


Three months ago, Chromebook users were hit by another severe issue [preventing them from logging into their devices](https://www.reddit.com/r/chromeos/comments/onlcus/update_it_seems_google_has_pulled_the_165_stable/) after updating to Chrome OS 91.0.4472.165.
