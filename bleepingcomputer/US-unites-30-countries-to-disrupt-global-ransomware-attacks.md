Today, U.S. President Joe Biden said that the U.S. will bring together 30 countries to jointly crack down on ransomware gangs behind a barrage of attacks impacting organizations worldwide.


"This month, the United States will bring together 30 countries to accelerate our cooperation in combatting cybercrime, improving law enforcement collaboration, stemming the illicit use of cryptocurrency, and engaging on these issues diplomatically," President Biden said today.


"We are also partnering closely with nations around the world on these shared threats, including our NATO allies and G7 partners.


"I am committed to strengthening our cybersecurity by hardening our critical infrastructure against cyberattacks, disrupting ransomware networks, working to establish and promote clear rules of the road for all nations in cyberspace, and making clear we will hold accountable those that threaten our security."


Ongoing battle against ransomware threat
----------------------------------------


This announcement comes as a response to recent attacks, including ransomware attacks on [Colonial Pipeline](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/colonial-pipeline/), [JBS Foods](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/food-giant-jbs-foods-shuts-down-production-after-cyberattack/), and [Kaseya](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/kaseya-roughly-1-500-businesses-hit-by-revil-ransomware-attack/) in the United States, which have revealed significant vulnerabilities across critical infrastructure worldwide.


President Biden also [issued a U.S. security memorandum](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/new-us-security-memorandum-bolsters-critical-infrastructure-cybersecurity/) to bolster the nation's critical infrastructure cybersecurity by setting baseline performance goals for critical infrastructure owners and operators.


Deputy National Security Advisor Anne Neuberger urged U.S. businesses [to take ransomware seriously](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/white-house-urges-businesses-to-take-ransomware-crime-seriously/) the same month, following the Colonial Pipeline and JBS ransomware attacks.


White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki added that the U.S. will [take action against ransomware groups](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/us-warns-of-action-against-ransomware-gangs-if-russia-refuses/) operating within Russia's borders if "the Russian government cannot or will not."


Since then, Moscow and Washington have managed to resume cooperation in multiple areas, with several hits on Evil Corp., TrickBot, and REvil gangs as a direct result, according to [Kommersant](https://www.kommersant.ru/doc/5007866).


Coalition against cybercrime
----------------------------


In July, [Interpol also urged industry partners and police agencies](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/interpol-urges-police-to-unite-against-potential-ransomware-pandemic/) worldwide to work together to disrupt the ransomware pandemic after G7 leaders [asked Russia to disrupt Russian-based ransomware gangs](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/g7-leaders-ask-russia-to-hunt-down-ransomware-gangs-within-its-borders/).


"Cyber threats can affect every American, every business regardless of size, and every community. That's why my administration is marshalling a whole-of-nation effort to confront cyber threats," President Biden [added](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/10/01/statement-by-president-joe-biden-on-cybersecurity-awareness-month/) today.


"We are building a coalition of nations to advocate for and invest in trusted 5G technology and to better secure our supply chains."


"And, we are bringing the full strength of our capabilities to disrupt malicious cyber activity, including managing both the risks and opportunities of emerging technologies like quantum computing and artificial intelligence."
