Proof-of-concept exploits for a critical zero-day vulnerability in the ubiquitous Apache Log4j Java-based logging library are currently being shared online, exposing home users and enterprises alike to remote code execution attacks.


[Log4j](https://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/index.html) is developed by the Apache Foundation and is widely used by both enterprise apps and cloud services.


Thus, while home users might have moved on from Java, anything from enterprise software to cloud software such as Apple's iCloud and Steam is likely vulnerable to RCE exploits targeting this vulnerability.


The bug, now tracked as **[CVE-2021-44228](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-44228)**, is an unauthenticated RCE vulnerability allowing complete system takeover, was [reported by Alibaba Cloud's security team](https://www.cyberkendra.com/2021/12/worst-log4j-rce-zeroday-dropped-on.html) to Apache on November 24. 


They also revealed that CVE-2021-44228 impacts default configurations of multiple Apache frameworks, including Apache Struts2, Apache Solr, Apache Druid, Apache Flink, and others.


Threat actors are already scanning the Internet [[1](https://twitter.com/bad_packets/status/1469225135504650240), [2](https://twitter.com/_mattata/status/1469144854672379905)] for systems vulnerable to this remotely exploitable security flaw that doesn't require authentication.

"Similarly to other high-profile vulnerabilities such as Heartbleed and Shellshock, we believe there will be an increasing number of vulnerable products discovered in the weeks to come," the Randori Attack Team said.


"Due to the ease of exploitation and the breadth of applicability, we suspect ransomware actors to begin leveraging this vulnerability immediately."


Lunasec, who dubbed the vulnerability **LogJam**, also underscored the severity of attacks using CVE-2021-44228 RCE exploits.


"Many, many services are vulnerable to this exploit. Cloud services like Steam, Apple iCloud, and apps like Minecraft have already been found to be vulnerable," Lunasec said.


"Anybody using Apache Struts is likely vulnerable. We've seen similar vulnerabilities exploited before in breaches like the 2017 Equifax data breach."


While Apache published a Log4j release candidate version (2.15.0-rc1) three days ago, likely containing a fix for this flaw, security researchers already discovered a bypass and recommend updating to the latest RC build [log4j-2.15.0-rc2](https://github.com/apache/logging-log4j2/releases/tag/log4j-2.15.0-rc2).
