Microsoft has released the first Windows 11 "Nickel" preview build 22449 to Windows Insiders in the 'Dev' channel, allowing them to test out new unstable features that are still being developed.


Since Windows 11 was officially announced, Microsoft has been testing builds in the 'Dev' and "Beta' Insider channels for the version to be released on October 5th, 2021, to the general public.


After announcing Windows 11's release date, Microsoft began emailing Windows Insiders in the 'Dev' channel warning them that they would soon be distributing unstable Windows 11 builds in this channel. Those who wished to continue testing stable versions of the Windows 11 build being released in October should switch to the 'Beta' channel.


"Since these builds are from the earliest stage in a new development cycle, they may not be stable and sometimes you will see issues that block key activities or require workarounds while running the Windows Insider Preview Builds in the Dev Channel," explained Microsoft in an email to Insiders.


Today, Microsoft has released their first build of the Windows 11 development branch known as "Nickel" to Insiders in the 'Dev' channel.

The new Windows 11 'Nickel' builds likely will be unstable, buggy, and more prone to crash. However, it will allow users to test in-development features from Microsoft before anyone else and will likely be a popular choice for many people.


This first release does not include any new features but includes ninety-four bug fixes for issues plaguing Windows 11 users who have been testing the new operating system.


Unfortunately, this build does not restore any of theÂ [missing Windows 11 features most requested by Windows Insiders](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/microsoft/windows-11-is-coming-soon-but-users-want-these-features-back/).


For example, it is still not possible to move the taskbar to the top or sides of the desktop, the taskbar context menu is still missing, and it is not possible to ungroup (unglom) open windows on the taskbar.


Many of these missing features are deal breakers for Windows 10 users looking to upgrade to Windows 11, and if Microsoft does not add them back, we may see many people sticking with Windows 10 for the time being.
