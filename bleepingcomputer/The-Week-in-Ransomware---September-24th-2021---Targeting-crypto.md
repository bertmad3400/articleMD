This week's biggest news is the [USA sanctioning a crypto exchange](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/us-sanctions-cryptocurrency-exchange-used-by-ransomware-gangs/) used by ransomware gangs to convert cryptocurrency into fiat currency. By targeting rogue exchanges, the US government is hoping to disrupt ransomware's payment system.


This other interesting news this week is a [list of vulnerabilities](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/researchers-compile-list-of-vulnerabilities-abused-by-ransomware-gangs/) commonly used by ransomware gangs and how the REvil operators reportedly use their operator key to [hijack negotiations from affiliates](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/revil-ransomware-devs-added-a-backdoor-to-cheat-affiliates/).
