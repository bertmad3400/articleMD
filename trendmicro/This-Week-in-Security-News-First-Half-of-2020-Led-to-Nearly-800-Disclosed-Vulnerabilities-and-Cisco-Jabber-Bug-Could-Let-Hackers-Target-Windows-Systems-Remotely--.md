*When thinking about 2020 security predictions, no one thought that there was a global pandemic brewing that would give cybercriminals an almost daily news cycle to take advantage of in their attacks against people and organizations around the world. While Covid-19 dominated the threat landscape in the first half of 2020, it wasn’t the only threat that defined it. Learn more about the 2020 threat landscape in Trend Micro’s recent blog.*

*Networking equipment maker Cisco has released a new version of its Jabber video conferencing and messaging app for Windows that includes patches for multiple vulnerabilities—which, if exploited, could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to execute arbitrary code. The flaws, which were uncovered by cybersecurity firm Watchcom during a pentest, affect all currently supported versions of the Jabber client (12.1-12.9) and has since been fixed by the company.*

*Published vulnerabilities in January through June of 2020 grew to 786, compared to 583 during the same time period last year, according to Trend Micro’s midyear cybersecurity report. Bad actors most often targeted enterprise software, including Apache Struts and Drupal frameworks, between 2017 and the first half of this year. In this article, Trend Micro’s director of global threat communications, Jon Clay, shares his thoughts on the first half of 2020.*

*Email is the number one threat vector. Data from Trend Micro Smart Protection Network shows that for the first five months of 2020, 92% of all the cyberthreats leveraging Covid-19 were spam or phishing email messages. Email scams can have a big impact, both on the organization and the individual. This was highlighted in a recent report from BBC News where a finance professional from Glasgow, Scotland was targeted by a business email compromise (BEC) scam.*

*In a single month, cyber-squatters registered almost 14,000 domain names, more than half of which went on to host malicious or likely fraudulent content, Palo Alto Networks states in a report released this week. The company, which collected information on newly registered domains in December 2019, found 13,857 domains classified by its software as cybersquatting based on lexical analysis.*
