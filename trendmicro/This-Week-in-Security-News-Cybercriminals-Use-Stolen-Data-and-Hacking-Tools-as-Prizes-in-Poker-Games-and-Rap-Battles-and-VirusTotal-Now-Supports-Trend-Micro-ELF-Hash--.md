*In this month’s Patch Tuesday update, Microsoft pushed out fixes for 87 security vulnerabilities – 11 of them critical – and one of those is potentially wormable.

*To help IoT and Linux malware researchers investigate attacks containing Executable and Linkable Format (ELF) files, Trend Micro created telfhash, an open-source clustering algorithm that helps cluster Linux IoT malware samples. VirusTotal has always been a valuable tool for threat research and now, with telfhash, users of the VirusTotal Intelligence platform can pivot from one ELF file to others.*

*Trend Micro recently observed an interesting payload deployment using the Metasploit Framework (MSF) against exposed Docker APIs. The attack involves the deployment of Metasploit’s shellcode as a payload, and researchers said this is the first attack they’ve seen using MSF against Docker. It also uses a small, vulnerability-free base image in order for the attack to proceed in a fast and stealthy manner.*

*A distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack sees an attacker flooding the network or servers of the victim with a wave of internet traffic so big that their infrastructure is overwhelmed by the number of requests for access, slowing down services or taking them fully offline and preventing legitimate users from accessing the service at all. DDoS attacks are one of the crudest forms of cyberattacks, but they’re also one of the most powerful and can be difficult to stop.*
