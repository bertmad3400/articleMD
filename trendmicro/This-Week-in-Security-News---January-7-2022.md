[Uber Bug, Ignored for Years, Casts Doubt on Official Uber Emails](https://threatpost.com/uber-bug-ignored-emails/177395/)


A simple-to-exploit bug that allows bad actors to send emails from Uber’s official system went unaddressed despite flagging by multiple researchers. Since the story was first reported, Uber has fixed the vulnerability. However, because it’s unknown whether the vulnerability has been exploited in the years that it existed, customers who gave up personal information in response to an official Uber email should take action to change their passwords immediately.


[Staging a Quack: Reverse Analyzing a Fileless QAKBOT Stager](/en_us/research/21/l/staging-a-quack-reverse-analyzing-fileless-qakbot-stager.html)


Further monitoring and analysis of Squirrelwaffle from Trend Micro’s incident response and extended detection and response teams (IR/XDR) found that one of Squirrelwaffle’s payloads includes QAKBOT, a banking trojan and infostealer that cybercriminals have been using since 2007. While QAKBOT is one of the payloads it stages filelessly in the registry, the stager is also capable of staging for more than one malware, a capability that can likely be abused for more campaigns in the future.
